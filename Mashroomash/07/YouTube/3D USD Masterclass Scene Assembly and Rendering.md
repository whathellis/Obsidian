(File Download: This series is a condensed version of a workshop which we taught in London for SideFX Houdini. Scene assembly and rendering are undergoing a major shift due to new advancements in the frameworks that we have access to. Since Universal Scene Description (USD) became open-source in 2016, studios have been hesitant to pick it up due to it being a new technology. However, as it has become stable and well documented, many studios are now making the move towards USD based workflows. Of the toolsets which allow the use of USD, Solaris is one of the most advanced and well put together. In this series, we will be exploring how to use USD through Houdini's Solaris toolset. Additionally, you will learn how to use MaterialX and Karma.)

This series is up for free thanks to SideFX, a huge thanks to them for supporting this content.

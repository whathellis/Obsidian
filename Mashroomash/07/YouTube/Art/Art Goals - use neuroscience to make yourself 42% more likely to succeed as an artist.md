(Description:: If we want to learn to draw or paint as fast and efficiently as possible, then we need a very clear goal in mind.)

'Getting good' is not specific enough, but it can be hard to quantify exactly what you want to achieve.

The best way to alleviate this is to go over what you have done (and thus what maybe hasn't worked so far), and then look at the work of other artists to find a level to aspire to.

We can then snapshot our current level, so that we can actually measure the growth we are making, and ensure that we are staying on track.

This video will show you how to do all of that.

# Transcript
[00:01](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1) time for another video and before we get started a big thank you and Shout out once again to everyone who has liked and subscribed so far it's really cool to see so many other people who are as 
[00:09](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=9) passionate about learning art as I am if you are new here I'm trying to improve my painting and drawing skills across a 10,000 hour time frame but making my Improvement as fast and efficient as 
[00:19](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=19) possible by using techniques from the world of meta learning neuroscience and autodidacticism and today we're going to look at how to figure out where you are on your learning pathway based on in 
[00:30](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=30) your current level for future comparisons a little on how to stay motivated and how to set goals when learning art if you've been following along with 
[00:38](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=38) these videos so far you know that we've established the five skill pillars that we need to get good at painting and drawing which are composition value color form and Technical skill these 
[00:52](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=52) five things while encompassing more specialist Fields can be thought of as the biggest most generic most abstracted skills that every artist needs regardless of what the they want to draw 
[01:00](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=60) anime or architecture we will begin learning and training these five skills but before we do that like any good experiment or development effort we need to set a 
[01:08](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=68) baseline so that we know where we are right now and where we want to get to to start I want to preload your minds with some Concepts that are going to be useful the first is reviewing by which I 
[01:20](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=80) mean being able to objectively look at your previous work to see where your strengths and weaknesses are next is baselining which is setting a point in time and skill to measure from and 
[01:29](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=89) compar to and finally goal setting which is picking where you want to go in your chosen field of study what you're seeing here are some 
[01:38](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=98) of my old sketchbooks and notes I started drawing when I was a teenager having seen anime for the first time and I took out at high school where I was told by not one but two teachers that I 
[01:47](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=107) was so terrible at drawing and painting that I was actually forced to study sculpture instead that is a true story that led me to major in 3D design where I did draw but only very basic sketches 
[01:57](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=117) of things like Furniture so I have been drawing on and off for years but it was always very unstructured learning just copying my favorite anime or Comics maybe trying to learn Anatomy by copying 
[02:07](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=127) images from an anatomy book and it left me incredibly frustrated because I just never felt like I was improving I still couldn't draw the things I wanted to like Anatomy unless I had the book to 
[02:16](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=136) look at and when I could draw it it still never came out as good as it did when I had a reference close by I couldn't draw my own original Comics or anime drawings like my favorite artist 
[02:25](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=145) could they had this ability to bring a story or World from their imagination to the AG it was like they somehow had this genetic ability to just draw anything from any angle and to make it look 
[02:35](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=155) really cool and stylish to tell stories to paint cool believable Concepts and my work seemed lame by comparison that was when I decided to start over and not only learn about art 
[02:45](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=165) as if it were a science but to also learn how to learn a subject called metal learning this was around 2020 and I treated it as a blank slate from which I 
[02:55](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=175) could redirect myself towards the same goal I had always had but in a more efficient and structured way working smarter not harder looking back I guess what I 
[03:05](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=185) wanted at the time was the road map that other artists had Ed to hit the levels they were working at somewh still at an incredibly young age and so this is what I did and if you 
[03:14](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=194) want to you're are welcome to follow along and try it yourself it's a good little exercise but by no means compulsory I just found it good for figuring out where I was at the time and 
[03:22](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=202) what my weaknesses were the road was the five skill pillars composition value color form and Technical skill and the good news was that despite my unstructured learning I must have gotten 
[03:33](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=213) at least some sort of foothold on these skills to get to this point so that's what I'm doing here analyzing my old work through the lens of the five skill pillars now this is 
[03:43](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=223) pretty easy for my previous work because I never used color in fact I believed I couldn't paint so I just never bothered and and the only time I ever worked with value was when I did things like 
[03:51](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=231) hatching my drawings these aren't finished sketches so composition's non-existent therefore the only things I was working on were the form pillar and the technical skill pillar with regards 
[04:02](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=242) to form I had two bad habits that annoyed me the first was drawing too small I would draw ahe the size for a postage stamp and this is not really big enough to play with anything worthwhile 
[04:10](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=250) so I needed to Draw Bigger also I had a habit of using really scratchy or wooly lines to try and rough in and draw my forms which are always present in the finished sketch it was distracting to 
[04:19](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=259) the viewer and hard to discern what the proper form lines were as you may have seen from my other videos I've managed to mostly alleviate this issue by choosing to work in pen when I feel like 
[04:28](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=268) I do need to rough in some form I do it with a very faint marker pen which is invisible once dried and in over anything you see that you think is good here is likely a reference from a photo 
[04:37](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=277) and the drawings where I tried working from imagination were always more obviously lacking it seemed to me that quantity was not making a difference and that maybe quality was the key to 
[04:46](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=286) Improvement so let's consider this previous work a footprint a record of where we have been up to this point in time the next thing I did was I really thought about what I wanted to achieve 
[04:55](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=295) with my Arts at the time I imagined maybe working as a professional conert artist maybe that's your goal but perhaps you just want to be able to tell your own stories or paint watercolor 
[05:04](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=304) portraits with people in your community try and think about what you want to do and where you want to be within the world of Art and this is not fixed you can change it at any time try not to 
[05:14](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=314) think in terms of say your Instagram follow account as a way of measuring your success or progress this is just a number and one likely at the mercy of a faceless computer algorithm so it's 
[05:23](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=323) never going to lead you to any sense of fulfillment as an artist when we talk about goal setting for art there are two broad types of goal image related and position related I gathered a bunch of 
[05:34](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=334) images of art that I admired and tried to distill it down to three artists one image from each that I thought best embodied this Vision I had for myself my future art self I did this within the 
[05:43](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=343) context of the skill pillars this is an image related goal because I using these images as a beacon to literally and physically represent where I want my future art self to be producing work 
[05:54](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=354) like this we will refer to these images as our Senpai images there are three artists who I keep coming back to again and again so there must be something inherent in their work that fascinates 
[06:03](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=363) me this provides a great opportunity to try and nail down what that is the first artist I picked is Patrick o'keef and this image in particular which is from the first spiderverse movie I probably 
[06:13](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=373) could have picked any image from that film but I chose this one and analyzing it through the lens of the skill pillar I like how compositionally it helps to tell the story you have the characters 
[06:22](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=382) framed as Silhouettes and there's a decent sense of scale the scene's quite lowkey and dark in value but that's being done deliberately to help frame the space and set up this emotional 
[06:31](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=391) moment the colors are not what you'd expect from a server room or technologically themed space because they're warm and a little bit unnerving but they work because the underlying 
[06:39](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=399) value structure works finally and I don't know if this is some digital painting or technical skill trick but the details like the wires and the lights as simple as they are just look 
[06:48](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=408) cool it makes everything feel so much more believable and it gives the eye areas to rest and drink in the detail in contrast to the fairly simple focal point the form and perspective really 
[06:58](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=418) create a fantastic IC sense of depth butke paints a lot of urban and City scenes which is something I really enjoy doing and so does the next artist I picked the thing I love about Rob 
[07:08](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=428) rupal's artwork is that the form is simplified into geometric shapes yet the colors and textures are still quite realistic the form pillar has been blunted down to remove anything too 
[07:16](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=436) detailed or shapely yet the color and value pillars are refined and sharp the fact that the forms have been trimmed down to really 2D graphic shapes means that he can control the composition more 
[07:25](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=445) easily and how your eye works its way through the image which is something I want to be able to do too the values and colors seem to be referenced from a photograph or from life but they're 
[07:34](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=454) accurate and believable the items in this image make it seem like a scene from everyday life but it's been changed enough that it's taken on this cool Illustrated stylized quality and so it 
[07:44](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=464) is to me at least more interesting than reality he has decided what he wanted to emphasize about this boat and painted it the final piece I have here is a character piece from the game Legends of 
[07:54](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=474) gruna which is part of the League of Legends universe and this style of illustration of rendering seems very popular at the moment maybe even a little bit cliched this is the sort of 
[08:03](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=483) art style that AI is glamoring to replicate the form of the character is believable yet still clearly stylized somewhat cartoony maybe like the sort of artwork that Pixar produces but it's 
[08:12](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=492) rendered to such a high degree that it's totally credible it feels real the lighting the value and the composition are controlled and helped to tell the story and the materials and textures all 
[08:20](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=500) feel believable too one thing I adore about the art for this card game is that each card has a color scheme that relates to the region the cards belong to so it's like a limitation that the 
[08:29](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=509) artists are forced to conform to for every piece of art produced and yet they come up with an awesome response to that challenge every single time it makes these images part of a consistent family 
[08:39](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=519) and if I could produce something a into this well that would be great if you can pick a single Senpai image to embody your desired art position then even better but I couldn't and so I have a 
[08:48](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=528) few we shall consider these at destination now those were image related goals but a position related goal is more about where you will be physically in the future so for art it might be to 
[08:58](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=538) have your own art Gallery showing or to get employed as an artist at RI in which case you should try and regularly visualize yourself achieving that goal imagine what it will feel like and then 
[09:06](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=546) work backwards from there to work out what criteria you need to meet to make that happen either the way it turns out that this action of defining our intentions is actually a wise thing to 
[09:16](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=556) do when making a big investment of your time in order to learn a new skill research suggests that those with a clear plan in mind to act as a destination are up to 42 times more 
[09:25](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=565) likely to achieve their goals and they're so important because they provide a source of motivation for me I prefer to have a concrete example of a high quality piece 
[09:33](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=573) of art and my goal is to be able to do that for myself and that's what motivates me image or position or both go with whatever motivates you personally some people feel hopeless 
[09:44](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=584) when they compare their current work to their Senpai image but please please don't it's natural to feel disheartened when you can see a huge gap between where you are now and your goal but 
[09:52](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=592) we're literally taking steps to fix that right now so try to flip those emotions on their head try to fire yourself up I actually do this by keeping a senpi image close to hand like a wallpaper on 
[10:02](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=602) my phone to remind myself of what I'm aspiring to achieve I often look at them before I start my daily training as well on a personal note drawing has been for me at times an escape if I felt bad or I 
[10:12](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=612) was struggling with things in life I use drawing to take my mind off the situation it's like a form of meditation for me I suppose if I ever let drawing become an unhappy place where I felt 
[10:21](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=621) miserable and unmotivated well that would really suck so I've tried really hard to stay motivated by looking at all the great art I find online as an achievable goal point that I can totally 
[10:30](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=630) reach if I work smart and not as an impossible Plateau I really hope that bit of advice helps somebody one day there are other types of goals that form an important part of a good strategy 
[10:39](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=639) like Milestone goals and smart goals but we'll go over those in more detail another time for now you just need that destination now progress in your art learning like progress in any skill that 
[10:49](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=649) requires what we call procedural learning such as music or kickboxing or creative writing is notoriously difficult to measure this is because we cannot test ourselves for a measured 
[10:59](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=659) increase in art skill like we can for say the bench press or Spanish vocabulary comprehension the only way to measure this growth is to take interval snapshots of our art and that's the last 
[11:09](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=669) part of this exercise using all of our current knowledge of the skill pillars even if that's absolutely zero we're going to produce a piece of art when you do this it's important to pick which 
[11:19](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=679) variables you want to fix in place so that a fair comparison can be made in the future the easiest variables to fix are the subject the tools and the time I'm actually going to do two studies 
[11:31](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=691) today to demo for your lovely viewers to try and align with the goals of different types of artists who might be watching first will be a character piece that's the subject with no background 
[11:40](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=700) rendered digitally in full color using Photoshop and a wcom tablet that's the tools and I'm not going to time myself on this piece but I will make a note of how long I spend on it that's my time 
[11:51](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=711) the second piece is going to be a traditional piece rendered in gouache in full color from a photo reference and this time I'm going to set myself a time limit of 1 1 hour as you can see there 
[12:00](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=720) are no right or wrong ways to go about doing this as long as you decide on the variables and keep them consistent when we repeat this exercise in the future you might spend 5 hours rendering to a 
[12:09](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=729) very polished level or you might have to abandon the image part finished at the 1 hour mark make sure it's relevant to your future art self if you never intend to work in color that's not a problem 
[12:19](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=739) just work in values or line if you only ever intend to draw anime make it an anime drawing or maybe your own original character if you want to work in oils and paint Landscapes then go do that but 
[12:28](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=748) but whatever you do remember you need to make it repeatable in the future using the same subject the same tools and the same amount of time so take any photos you need to or save any files you need 
[12:38](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=758) for future reuse and most importantly keep this produced piece of art safe we will be revisiting it so let me show you mine what variables I locked in and how I'm considering the skill pillars so 
[12:49](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=769) this is the first piece I created I wanted to make a character piece without a background and I ended up settling on Rio and Chun from Street Fighter just off the top of my head because they're 
[12:58](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=778) recognizable character S I have a male and female figure that gives me the chance to practice some different types of anatomy and some different materials and I felt it would be relevant to all 
[13:06](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=786) those watching who might be interested in producing more anime style drawings you'll notice that the Senpai images I chose were all digitally produced and so I wanted to make a digital piece as well 
[13:15](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=795) the poses and Anatomy here are entirely from my imagination because I wanted to push myself but I did reference the costumes and the colors for each character you can see I Loosely put in 
[13:25](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=805) some perspective and I've tried to construct the figures in space to conform to this perspective layout that's working the form pillar I wasn't too concerned with composition for this 
[13:33](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=813) one but by the end looking back I felt that some of the angles and shapes created by the figures felt a bit unbalanced so that's something I'm going to come back and seek to adjust in the 
[13:41](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=821) future I wanted to light the characters from above and I tried to consider whether the Shadows would fall if this were the case and how the lighting would help describe the form and make 
[13:49](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=829) everything feel voluminous color scheme is pretty much decided on because the characters are based on an existing franchise but I didn't color pick anything that means I eyeballed every 
[13:58](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=838) color myself myself and I tried to make the shadow areas cooler on Ryu and warmer on Chun le as mentioned I actually know very very little about color so this really is just me trying 
[14:07](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=847) my best as a beginner at digital painting wishing somewhere in the back of my mind that this looks more like the art made by my Senpai artists color is definitely something I need to improve 
[14:16](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=856) on for next time the other thing this threw up for me was that I have no clue what sort of workflow professional artists use in programs like Photoshop to produce finished illustrations I just 
[14:26](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=866) blagged my way through this and probably missed all sorts of useful shortcuts or tricks that would have made a big difference so that's something I definitely need to try and learn at some 
[14:33](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=873) point an improvement to the technical skill pillar all in all this took 45 minutes to draw and then around 2 hours to paint some minus distractions it probably comes in at around 2 and 1/ 
[14:42](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=882) half hours of work I could have continued but I just felt like i' done all I could within my current skill level by this point and so I decided to stop I am aware that a piece polished to 
[14:51](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=891) the standard of the legends of Runa art that I showed earlier can take upwards of 8 hours to render and that image was contributed to by three separate artists so maybe I need to spend more time on 
[15:01](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=901) this in future Renditions get the idea now I just tried my best thinking about the skill pillars for the second piece I got a photo I took from my phone I try to take photos of compositions I like at 
[15:12](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=912) work or when I visit places and I try to remember what it looked like and felt like to be there at that moment this is something you can't get from a photo taken by someone else and so I encourage 
[15:21](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=921) you to take your own photos wherever possible you have a camera in your pocket anyway so you might as well I wanted to work in gouache in full color and I didn't want to put in a sketch I 
[15:31](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=931) just wanted to go for it and try to capture the shapes in the photo directly in paint and remember I'm limiting myself to 1 hour to complete this study it measures 4 in square and in terms of 
[15:42](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=942) composition I'm just following the photo but when I took this image last summer I tried to get the vanishing point on the right third of the photo and I tried to get the line where the trees meet the 
[15:50](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=950) slope on the upper third line to try and create a nice composition using the rule of thirds as previously mentioned I know very little about colors this is genuinely just me trying my my best to 
[15:59](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=959) get something decent with my very limited knowledge I only used three colors which were the primaries red blue and yellow as well as white and black using Windsor and Newton designer 
[16:09](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=969) gouache and this is a watercolor Sketchbook with 200 GSM paper I started by underpainting the whole scene in a yellow wash probably a little bit too intensely in hindsight but it's 
[16:19](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=979) something I've tried before and it felt like it made a difference showing through underneath everything else and making the end result seem brighter it also helps us somewhat unify the colors 
[16:27](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=987) if handled correctly which I'm not sure I managed here but the intention was definitely there found it quite difficult to match a few of the colors like for the sky without a more cion 
[16:35](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=995) blue I was also very limied the amount of greens I could create with such a limited palette so as I learned more about the color pillar I definitely want to expand my palette a bit more one 
[16:43](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1003) thing I did find easier than usual was the idea of seeing the colors as values I felt that I managed to get some form depicted in the distant tree line I tried the same thing with the clouds but 
[16:52](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1012) found that a lot harder when you do a painting like this you find that the color value and form pillars really are all just the same thing you can isolate them when training but when executing a 
[17:01](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1021) finished painting they really just form one big pillar finally the technical skill pillar really needs work I'm still not that experienced with gouache and sometimes I make mistakes like working 
[17:10](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1030) an area too much and reactivating what's underneath I also struggled to get the grassy texture to show through with brushes but I remember the trick that alosha Blau uses where he adds paint to 
[17:19](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1039) a pen nib and draws with the paint which makes thin details like grass very easy to depict after around 45 minutes I felt I really couldn't do much more so I stopped I came away feeling that I need 
[17:29](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1049) to learn a lot more about gouache as a material and that once again my lack of understanding of color is really letting me down so I have some Intel now and where my weaknesses are at this moment 
[17:38](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1058) and this is our art snapshot we'll be recreating it set intervals in the future to see how we've improved using the same references or subjects with the same materials and potentially the same 
[17:47](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1067) time frame how often you do this is entirely down to you some people might prefer to leave it a year I'll be recreating my studies every 200 hours to try and track my progress for the 
[17:57](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1077) purposes of this channel which will be sometime in 2024 given my current training regime with this we have our road map partially completed we can see where we have been where we are going 
[18:07](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1087) and where we are right now so to recap we have discussed how having a road map is useful for getting good art or any other skill you care to master how our previous experience has led us to this 
[18:17](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1097) point where we are right now where we are going and how to measure progress for slippery hardto measure skills like art by reperform a baseline action at set intervals thanks for watching I hope 
[18:29](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1109) that helped I'd love to know what your art goals are if you feel like sharing them in the comments but as I mentioned this is not an absolute necessity for being good at art or anything else I 
[18:36](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1116) just found that it helped me and the Neuroscience studies I've read regarding goal setting do support it if you'd like to read more about goal setting and how it can help you a good introduction to 
[18:45](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1125) the subject is learn like a pro by Barbara Oakley and Olaf sh we have our art learning map started now we need the directions to get from here to there which will be the subject of my next 
[18:55](https://youtu.be/nRg8rSw5n8w?si=wFZmk7BVS3Yyw_FS&t=1135) video so I hope you can join me next time we'll be going over the learning Concepts that I believe hold the key to turbocharging your art learning and how to implement

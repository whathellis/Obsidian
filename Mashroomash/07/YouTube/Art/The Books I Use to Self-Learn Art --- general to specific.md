(Description:: Many people ask me about the books I use for my experiment in using spaced repetition to self-learn drawing and painting, so here's a video stating which books I use for studying the various aspects of art, why I chose them, and how I found them.)

Each of these books has been turned into an Anki deck, so that I can use it for my spaced repetition learning experiment.

To learn how to make your own decks from books, courses, or anything else, for any subject you wish to study using this powerful technique, please check out the video links below:

[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=0) time for another video and before we get started a big thank you and Shout out once again to everyone who has liked and subscribed so far this is a channel dedicated to helping others improve as 
[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=9) artists in the most efficient manner possible by leveraging the research of Neuroscience meta learning and autodidacticism and today I'd like to finish our discussion on spaced 
[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=19) repetition learning with a look into something that people have shown a great deal of interest in which is the books I have used as a load star to take me towards Mastery of painting and drawing 
[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=28) some of these books you may have seen before if you follow the channel but I will show some I've never discussed before today as well so today we will be looking at how to find the best books 
[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=37) when trying to learn a new skill the books are used personally and why books are special in the world of learning as well as why we have as a global Society forgotten their true meaning and usage 
[00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=47) I've said this before but I want you to remember something when seeking sources to learn from especially as a beginner you want to avoid getting too specific and instead focus on the broadest most 
[00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=58) generic most abstracted principles you can find is these will Propel you the furthest what I mean by that is if you're a total beginner at Art and start following an online course for how to 
[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=68) draw anime characters and it jumps into things like clothing folds and poses you'll probably fail like I failed the reason is that this teacher is probably already good at drawing generically that 
[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=79) is drawing foundational things like anatomy and threedimensional looking volumes yet now they're teaching something specific like clothing folds and poses if you try to train this 
[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=88) specific thing with no General Foundation then you'll probably find that your drawings look off you become dissatisfied with your work and possibly 
[01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=95) give up drawing all together unless you understand perspective line weight overlap Anatomy shape language and all these other General artistic Concepts you'll never be able to more 
[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=104) specifically draw anime characters as well as the people who are drawing with these foundations already under their belts the problem I found is that most teachers are coming at you from that 
[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=114) position and assuming that you are there too it's not their fault they assume you already know the basic stuff they might even mention that you should be using it in passing but it takes a while to learn 
[02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=124) and so you struggle along with the content getting more and more annoyed and giving up on Art simply put most courses YouTube videos and books tend to assume some pre-existing skill and 
[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=135) experience as I grew more frustrated with these materials and the lack of prerequisite teaching I wonder why nobody had ever just made a simple road map that took you from being a total 
[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=144) beginner to being able to draw a paint whatever you want if that was even possible but my prayers were answered when I discovered Scott Robertson's books how to draw and how to render it's 
[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=153) not so much that Scott is an amazing artist he is but there are many of those what separates Scots books from those of others is that he is a good teacher and that is what you should be seeking out 
[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=164) when carrying out your searches for good sources of Education whereas other learning sources May gloss over certain key aspects or explain them in a confusing order Scott seems to be able 
[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=173) to say the most with the least amount of words and get you doing the things that make the biggest difference in your learning some of the stuff I will cover today is specific to things like 
[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=182) Landscapes or comic books but these two books how to draw and how to render are the most General they don't cover drawing heads or scenery or comic book panels but I promise you that everything 
[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=192) in here will be used for the rest of your life when drawing or painting anything if you are a total beginner this is a great place to start if you're experienced but getting frustrated then 
[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=201) you probably need to brush up on the things in here basically whoever you are these books will probably benefit your art in some way and none of the other books in the video today can claim that 
[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=211) and better still it's laid out as a road map and it covers the generic most abstractive principles of drawing form it takes you from drawing lines and circles without a ruler or guides to 
[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=221) grasping basic perspective and then complex perspective you can learn how to turn the simple forms you can draw into airplanes and then cars while considering camera lenses and view 
[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=229) angles it teaches you that everything you could ever want to draw is made up of cross-sections in 3D space and how to combine them to make anything from any angle this is what we see artists like 
[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=241) Kim jungi doing orbe it in his head and this is really the entire conceptual overview of the how to draw book that 2D cross-sections arranged in perspective make realistic looking three-dimensional 
[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=251) volumes this is how I've got to my current level of drawing skill the second book Builds on the first showing how to plot Shadows for your objects and assign values to them to make them 
[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=262) appear solid from there you learn how value is related to color and how to make things more or less reflective as well as how to make them look like they're made of different materials this 
[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=270) forms a fantastic foundation to take you from the more General aspects of art to the world of more specific things like Landscapes or Anatomy or the intricacies of color and light the road map style of 
[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=282) these books and their very generic foundational focus is my main reason for recommending them so highly another book that works like this but is more specific in scope is called get started 
[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=292) with gouache by Emma block it features a simple lesson plan to follow that takes you from painting swatches with different colors or opacity P of paint to working in negative space and 
[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=302) building up to eventually painting animals food people and places you can work in a simple illustrative style like Emma does to get a feel for the medium of gouache very quickly or apply 
[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=311) knowledge you have from other books and resources to build on these simple lessons and make them whatever you want she has a similar book on watercolors as well she's an excellent teacher and 
[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=320) author who has clearly considered how to best take you along a logical path from getting used to how paint handles to using it to make complex images like Landscapes another painter who produces 
[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=330) books like this is Victoria semanova but I personally prefer the lessons and examples covered by Emma block that's just me though speaking of painting I only started learning to paint early 
[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=340) this year it's a complex subject that can be thought of as equal parts mastering the actual medium and Mastery of how color and light work I chose road map style books like those just 
[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=350) discussed to start learning it because they present a clear and logical path to take you in Baby Steps From a total beginner to actually standing on your own and running your own experiments but 
[05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=359) there are other books that take a different slightly more openly experimental approach from the beginning you've probably already seen me mention the book rediscovering gouache by alosha 
[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=367) Blau while not so much of a road map style book it explores many different ways to work with gouache which are highly unique he uses sponges and read pens to create specific textures and 
[06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=377) while color and light are mentioned I consider this more of a valuable book for learning how the medium of gouache works and the experimental approach encourages the reader to undertake in 
[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=386) learning that this is the next best sort of book when no Road map is present experimental encouragement it should give you an idea and encourage you to experiment with it and stress test it to 
[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=396) see what you can do with it this is closer to the concept of what we call immersion learning where we just roll up our sleeves and start doing the work without any basic training but instead 
[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=405) of blindly jumping into immersion and struggling we have someone telling us what to do and what to avoid which will save you some time in your learning I have another book on gouache I use which 
[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=413) is the art of gouache by Jeremy Ford and this one features some interesting uses of gouache in what he refers to as a post style which is how a lot of the old school iconic British Rail adverts were 
[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=423) created my older UK viewers May fondly remember them I also like his approach to painting gradients with gouache and once again I consider this more of a how to use gouache book than a how to use 
[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=433) color and light book this one is the weakest in terms of teaching and it really just contains a few techniques that the artist uses and how he uses them which is useful but not really for 
[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=442) a beginner these books were viewing paint more in terms of the technical skill pillar that is how the paint handles and ways to apply apply it when looking for books on painting you might 
[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=452) find that they tend to fit this format and cover more on how to use the paint be it oils or watercolors than how to use paint to represent reality to look more closely at representing reality we 
[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=463) do need to become well versed in using color and light expertly this has been a huge stumbling block for me personally and the main reason I have probably started and stopped painting several 
[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=472) times in my life I would paint using the colors straight from the tubes and yet the colors would end up muddy or looking off compared to those artists I admire who can make the paint look as if it's 
[08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=481) glowing or like there's real light and Shadow at play on a piece of paper my favorite book on this subject is color and Light by 3D total publishing they're a uk- based company that make a lot of 
[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=491) art books and we'll see some more of their products later they have some material available for free on their website so you might consider checking them out color and light starts very 
[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=500) simply by walking you through the individual aspects of color in terms of importance which would be value chroma and Hue it discusses the difference between chroma and saturation how 
[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=509) exposure works and how to Kia painting to get the correct exposure in this sense it's a bit of a road map style book but leaning more heavily on the theory side of things my favorite thing 
[08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=519) about it though is that it specifically tells you how you can isolate and train some of these aspects for example if you want to play with chroma in Photoshop you paint with a single color and only 
[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=530) adjust the value and saturation sliders this will limit your ability to select colors to a narrow range as you will only be able to make your single Hue warmer cooler light lighter or darker to 
[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=541) do this with traditional paint just pick a warm and cool variant of any single color black and white this is how I'm learning to wrap my head around how artists with more mileage than me see 
[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=550) color and how they decide which direction to adjust their Paints in as they work I value these aha moments whenever I find them as they help me level up my knowledge and understanding 
[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=560) sometimes you just need someone to explain something to you in a certain way it also talks about light and how it works which overlaps with a lot of the stuff in the how to render book by 
[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=569) Robertson but I don't mind this when looking at books many of them repeat the same thing but this actually helps us immensely that's because if something is mentioned so prolifically across so many 
[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=579) books then it must be the most important thing to study that means you want to spend more time there mastering that thing first in order to gain the biggest increase in skill it's also beneficial 
[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=589) to have the same info explained by different authors who give their own twist and help you to understand the subject from slightly nuanced perspectives fleshing out your own 
[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=597) personal understanding the book thing goes even further by showing you how a bunch of super talented artists like guay and Nathan Falks go about constructing their paintings using the 
[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=606) information you just learned this is great because instead of getting one artist usually the author showing how they apply a lesson we get different high-profile artists showing us their 
[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=616) individual approaches we can compare what they all do what they do differently to one another and what they do which is the same and this is very useful one thing that annoys people 
[10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=624) about 3D total is that their books always feature a gallery section in the back that means this big Hefty book you just paid a lot of money for might be a third full of people's paintings but 
[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=633) only 2/3 full of learning information I understand that complaint but I personally like the gallery sections as they help to demonstrate different ways artists have used the information in the 
[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=643) book and give you new sources of inspiration a lot of this is about trying to get as much as you can out of any one book so even something which is just filler can have some valuable 
[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=653) knowledge extracted from it another book I highly recommend is color and Light by James gurny and yes it has the same name as the previous book this one doesn't feel like it explains things as 
[11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=662) logically as the 3D total book but for a long time this was the only book on the market that really discuss this stuff in an easily digestible way it explains things at the 3D total book lacks as 
[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=672) well such as specific lighting setups like conture and how they impact us emotionally it also shows us how the Old Masters used color and light back in the days when far fewer pigments were 
[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=682) available to paint with unlike the 3D total book it makes no mention of digital art so that might affect its usefulness to you other book I would give an honorable mention to here are 
[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=691) ala Prima by Richard Schmid which is fantastic but relates to mostly oils and it assumes a fair bit of pre-existing skill another one I like for watercolors is mastering atmosphere and mood in 
[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=700) watercolor by Joseph spooki but from the names alone you can probably tell that these books deal with more advanced specific areas of painting and so they're not that beginner friendly as a 
[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=710) result there are no road maps to guide you here but they do feature ideas and experiments for you to try once you have some experience while color and light are used to great effect in everything 
[11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=719) from product Concepts to portraits one of the areas where you really do need to have the mastered is in landscape painting if the things we've covered so far are more generic and getting 
[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=728) gradually more specific now we have entered a niche painting the scenery around us to paint Landscapes you need everything covered in the books that we have mentioned so far that is a good 
[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=739) solid ground in form some skill with handling paint and a knowledge of how value color and lights work Landscapes bring their own challenges and one such headache for a beginner is called 
[12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=749) composition not only do we have to be able to do all of the things that we have looked at so far but we also have to be able to narrow our Focus to zone out most of the stuff in front of us and 
[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=758) paint just a small slice of it possibly even altering it to fit our canvas better composition is equal parts logical and emotional where we place elements on a canvas appeases us as 
[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=768) humans when done correctly and like any system this can be exploited to evoke certain emotions within the viewer combine this with all the knowledge you have now for color and light and you 
[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=777) should be able to lead the viewer's eyes to a you want them to go and capture what fascinates you about your scene there is one author who I really like for landscape specifically and that's 
[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=785) Mitchell albala he has two books which are actually very similar to one another called landscape painting and the landscape painters workbook the latter is the newer one and it acts like a bit 
[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=795) of an update to the first you see the first one was more about working in oils but the second one generalizes the lessons there's that word again to make them more readily applicable for people 
[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=804) who want to work in soft pastels watercolors or anything else the book takes you through the the importance of value in a different way to the other books we have seen so far you'll learn 
[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=813) that thinking in just two values black and white is ultimately all you need to direct the eye to wherever you want in a painting you'll be doing paint studies using four values to break the landscape 
[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=823) up into Sky areas that directly face the sky which we call Ground planes areas that half face the sky and areas that do not face the sky at all it's a remarkably similar system to the one 
[13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=834) employed by Scott Robertson in how to render and that's because this is how light works however this version of the system is viewed through the lens of Landscapes exclusively you'll also work 
[14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=844) on how to frame the vast landscapes in front of you learn more about color especially how to mix different types of green and making decisions about what to include but more importantly what to 
[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=853) emit from the scene in front of you and that's the reason I like these books so much painting Landscapes or anything else is really about learning to see in a very specific way where we subtract as 
[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=863) much detail as possible to paint the most basic information these books will teach you how to see like that and that is something we can apply to other things like painting people Anatomy is 
[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=874) probably the biggest stumbling block for most people I think when I started learning Anatomy I got confused by the fact that some artists quickly used gestural drawing to make awesome figures 
[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=883) While others meticulously crafted perfect anatomical images then there was anime and comic books and across this broad spectrum of different anatomical Styles I didn't see how learning the 
[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=893) muscles or figure drawing eventually led to any one of them how important were all these muscle groups and stuff could you really memorize them like Kim jungi and be able to draw them from any angle 
[15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=902) purely from imagination well you can but in order to manage that you really do have to have mastered the stuff that we discussed earlier in this video first you see 
[15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=911) Anatomy is a more specific offshoot a niche like Landscapes and so it has to be supported by those foundational skills we saw earlier once you can draw boxes in perspective from imagination 
[15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=921) you realize that the human body and any part of it fits inside a box and that's most of the work done for you the rest is a little understanding of proportions and the shapes and forms of the 
[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=930) different body parts how they lock together how they move and how they deform sounds simple but you and I both know it's anything but I have many anatomy books in my collection including 
[15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=940) the ones I was recommended to pick up when I first started learning the classics by authors George Bridgeman burn Hogarth and Andrew Lumis you've likely heard of the Lumis method for 
[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=950) example as the go-to way to construct a head I spent a lot of time just copying images from these books and when I tried to draw a human without the book something and happened I failed 
[16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=960) miserably I couldn't recall exactly how things were supposed to look and I couldn't get the angles right and it was down to just copying the sketches as shapes like tracing them but on a 
[16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=970) different page without the tracing paper I was very good at copying shapes and angles in the drawings but the problem is I was not thinking about them as 3D forms turning in space to help you get 
[16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=980) on the right track there is a more recent book that approaches figure drawing entirely from that Viewpoint and that's drawing form and pose by Tom Fox Tom is an interesting guy he had no art 
[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=990) experience and he studied zoology at University he worried he would have no applicable skills upon graduating and wanted to practice something cheap and easy to pick up so he started drawing a 
[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=999) decade or so later and he's gone from being a total Noob to almost Kim jungi levels able to draw figures and entire scenes totally from his imagination if he can do it so can I and if I can do it 
[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1010) so can you his book starts by introducing you to the most important ways to depict form which are thinking in 3D or XYZ terms of Scott Roberton calls them this concept must be 
[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1020) important because it's covered in both books but it also covers some new Concepts you can bring into your drawing which we have not encountered yet that will be things like overlap to create 
[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1029) depth simplification to make the viewer fill in the blanks of your drawings leaving gaps in your lines for shortening and Contour drawing where we focus on the silhouette of the figure 
[17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1038) and think in more two-dimensional terms this gives us multiple approaches to drawing we can work in threedimensional XYZ terms that we've seen so far but we can also draw the figure as a flat two 
[17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1048) dimens cardboard cutout and both methods have their merits and limitations the majority of the book however is dedicated to exactly what I mentioned earlier how each part of the 
[17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1058) body is broken down into simple forms how they fit together and how they move and de form in space there is one more thing that my time studying Anatomy has revealed though and I feel this is what 
[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1067) makes it one of the things that people find hard to get their head around initially upon trying to draw the human figure let's say that Tom's work is at 50% on a sliding scale he only shows as 
[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1078) much detail on his figures as he thinks necessary letting the brain of the viewer fill in the blanks this concept of reduction and simplification is another very important lesson to 
[18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1088) understand for all of Arts but it can be hard to express that limited detail without knowledge of the more complex detail it actually represents for example if we move all the way to the 
[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1097) right on this scale where we draw maximum detail I have this book Anatomy for sculptors by oldest Zarin it says this for sculptors but you can use it for painting and drawing too it breaks 
[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1107) down the body into forms like Tom Fox's book does but in a different way as well as showing you the actual fiber level muscle detail should you care to learn that I used this book to make sure I 
[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1117) understand the body in great detail but then I'll draw it more at the 50% level like Tom Fox does but there is another thing that we see some artists do they reduce the body down even further 
[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1128) sliding this scale all the way to the left transforming it into more shapes or quick gestures this is more like what some cartoonists or anime achieve an understandable human figure but heavily 
[18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1139) stylized if you suck at drawing anime and this may be the reason why can you see how these artists possess everything we have covered so far including the anatomy slider being closer to 100% if 
[19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1151) you only ever a train down here at 10% drawing anime Anatomy you do not understand enough about the higher levels to reduce it down correctly I found that the best books for viewing 
[19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1160) Anatomy through this simplified lens are some books by South Korean artist called Taco they have a couple of books called Point character drawing and secret character drawing I only have the point 
[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1170) character one right now as the other one has not been translated into English yet this book is useful for a couple of things firstly it breaks down some of the simple measurements and checks you 
[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1179) can bear in mind when constructing figures to make them look more correct for example the distance between the hairline and the nose is usually the same measurement as the length of the 
[19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1187) neck once you have that information internalized a quick check in your drawing and you can make a character look more or less realistic it also deals with anatomy in this simpler shape 
[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1196) based approach showing you how you can depict more complex threedimensional forms using placements of 2D shapes I would not recommend doing this unless you have spent some time thinking in 3D 
[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1206) or you'll end up doing what I did being excellent at drawing these shapes but not being able to draw them from any angle without the book handy because the concept of 3D space will be alien to you 
[20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1216) learn the form first then learn to reduce it with books like this you can also hopefully now see why just copying your favorite manga anime or Comics might not have actually given you the 
[20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1225) skills to draw like the creators you admire they drew that a cute anime girl thinking about reduced anatomy and 3D forms whereas you are copying shapes in 2D terms from that reduced outcome never 
[20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1236) appreciating the more advanced framework that is secretly hidden underneath it if you can understand the framework though then you can go nuts and start to copy your faves and develop a bit of their 
[20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1246) style I have a whole bunch of manga books that I got mostly to read but also for the art manga books didn't really start appearing in stores where I live in the UK until maybe the mid ughs like 
[20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1257) 2004 when I was in my late teens I remember the first time I saw a blade of the immortal and was instantly hooked I had to be able to draw like this I copied so many images from those books 
[21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1268) and I still like to do this occasionally to this day but I now do so understanding that hiroaki samura and other artists like him are creating these with a very potent understanding 
[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1278) of everything we have discussed so far as well as a new skill how to assemble images to sell a story that is something you can learn from copying these books though other favorites of mine include 
[21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1288) anything by Shawn Murphy Mike magnola Rafael Albuquerque and Jason lur I also really like chainsaw man by tatsuki Fujimoto when you look at Art you admire try and think what it is you like about 
[21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1300) it and focus on that if you want to do studies like this try and really hone in on the thing you want to absorb from the art and practice that is it the expressive Line work is it the way the 
[21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1310) anatomy is simplified is it the Mastery of difficult perspective this can then inform you and show you what more generic things you need to train to help you reach their levels the issue with 
[22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1320) this sort of copying from books however is that it is unguided you are not being explicitly taught art lessons by the author but have to have enough skill to be able to find them expressed in their 
[22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1330) finished work another book that gets an honorable mention for storytelling is framed Inc by Marcus Mato M this book examines what a lot of your favorite comic artists and film directors are 
[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1341) doing all the time which is telling stories with images and the placement of elements on the canvas page your screen it's quite similar to the AL landscape books in that it focuses on using two 
[22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1350) values black and white and how it can use lighting and placement of forms and shapes to guide the eye in VOC motions and tell our stories it will change the way you watch movies you can use the 
[22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1361) simple templates in the book to experiment with your own compositions another book that I found to be perhaps the simplest way for learning this concept is Picture This by Molly bang it 
[22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1370) uses cut pieces of card rearranged with each turning of the page to help exaggerate certain ideas we want to express to the viewer and it's another one of those books that's excellent 
[22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1379) because it's set out like a road map and deals with a very general concept that can be applied to all of art every time you turn the page he has tweaked her composition a little to exaggerate an 
[23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1388) idea she wants to express and you can see it happening for yourself so it makes learning very easy there are other specialist niches in art you might want to track down books for that I have not 
[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1397) covered here things like working with oil paints or drawing animals there is also observational drawing which is a basic skill for which I would recommend the book drawing course by Charles bar 
[23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1407) but I want to disc observational drawings separately in a future video these books are all more specific and we are getting into the little nooks and crannies of art that you probably 
[23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1417) shouldn't really be concerned with until you have a firm grasp of the basics for example I have another couple of books by 3D total here one is the beginner's guide to creating portraits and the 
[23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1427) other is the beginner's guide to digital painting in Photoshop how specific is that no mention of color theory or value here just how to get up and running in Photoshop if you bought this book alone 
[23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1438) as as a beginner wanting to learn to paint your paintings would never reach the lofty Heights of the artists using Photoshop that you admire because remember they have mastered the more 
[24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1447) generic foundational principles of Arts they are not mentioned in this book it assumes you already know them and so you would get frustrated when your paintings don't look like the examples shown there 
[24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1457) is one more thing you may have picked up on so far although these books are awesome no single book covers everything you need a collection of books and other resources to build up a decent idea of 
[24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1468) how a field really works in order to learn it this may also include inperson lessons online courses or anything else that you feel you can learn from so why do I find books so useful I've probably 
[24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1480) taken as many art courses as I have read books and I'm still not an expert sitting through these videos and courses just like reading the books will actually do nothing for you it's the 
[24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1488) practice bit we need these resources are merely the guides videos and courses are better than books in that we can see the process in action which I find useful for reinforcing what I learned from the 
[24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1498) books Some people prefer to learn via courses or even YouTube and there are people with conditions like dyslexia who really cannot use books to learn from very well that's totally fine everyone 
[25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1508) learns differently but there really is something special about books books force their creators to logically map out every point they want to express and then refine it to fit inside a limited 
[25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1519) page count it has to be poignant and it has to be simple videos are usually compressed down to a time lapse in order to achieve the same thing and while not always the case they tend to suffer as a 
[25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1529) result delivering watered down lessons my own videos included if you take something like an autobiography what you hold is an entire person's life all their lessons learned all their 
[25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1539) experience and all their knowledge in a single tone non-fiction books may contain ideas and Concepts that an individual like Steven Hawking dedicated their entire life to grappling with he 
[25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1549) sat down and wrote about everything he learned Decades of work condensed it into an easily digestible block of paper so that you can get up to speed with it in just a few days of reading 
[25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1558) can you see the power of this books allow for the transfer of knowledge very quickly and this is how Human Society has grown to the level it has we can distill down an entire lifetime's worth 
[26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1569) of lessons capture them and share them with others but there's a problem and I was first made aware of it by the book moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua 4 it's about an American journalist going 
[26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1580) from writing a piece about the world memory championships to training for and winning the very same Championship a year or two later if you're interested in meta learning and NE science is a 
[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1589) good book but not so much for arts in the book Joshua talks about how back in medieval times books were not common place like they are today because paper was very expensive and books had to be 
[26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1599) copied by hand there was no printing press yet if you went to somebody's house instead of asking to see their brand new games console or graphics card that nobody can seem to buy anywhere you 
[26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1609) would have asked to see their book and these books were precious because they all contained ideas and Concepts that only the wealthy could afford to learn instead of going to Paris to learn 
[26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1618) directly from someone you could read their writings and learn that way instead it was revolutionary people would only own a single book they were that expensive and when they finished 
[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1627) reading it they started over and read it again fiercely trying to internalize the knowledge it contained it was effectively space repetition learning but then something happened around 1463 
[27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1637) Johanna schenberg invented the printing press and suddenly books became much easier to create this was another Revolution because it democratized books and therefore learning now anyone rich 
[27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1648) or poor could learn to read and then read to learn but it had another effect on us an unforeseen one because books were now cheaper we read them and then we left them on the shelf or threw them 
[27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1658) away we would read them one time and move on to the next one retaining very little of the information inside them I bet if I asked you what you can remember about a book you have read you would 
[27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1667) only be able to recall Snippets perhaps the bits that had the most impact on you but by rereading the same book or better yet a book chopped up into anky cards you gain the ability to glean new 
[27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1677) information every time you revisit it and by making notes in it you expand your understanding of the subject further there are more books than we will ever be able to read and more 
[28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1686) knowledge out there than we will ever be able to learn so we need to find the books that will impact us the most and here's the key difference study them repeatedly that's really what I'm using 
[28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2_zpl738Kw&list=WL&index=82&t=1696) Anki for I'm trying to treat books in the same way that they were once seen with the respect they deserve and an appreciation for the knowledge they contain Tom Fox spent 10,000 hours

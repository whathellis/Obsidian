100/10,000 hours 

(Description:: I recently passed 100 hours of drawing and painting, and so decided to review what I have learned so far to share with you all.)

Painting is not covered here, because I spent far more time drawing, but I will cover what I have learned about painting in a future video.

All 100 hours of drawing and painting were produced using a spaced repetition learning model, which you can learn more about here:

[00:01](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=1) time for another video and before we get started a big thank you and Shout out once again to everyone who has liked and subscribed so far this is a channel dedicated to helping others improve as 
[00:10](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=10) artists in the most efficient manner possible by leveraging the research of Neuroscience meta learning and autodidacticism I know I said my next video would be about the books I use and 
[00:21](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=21) a deep dive into them and that video is underway but in the meantime I recently passed my first 100 hours of painting and drawing which I share here on YouTube as daily shorts 
[00:30](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=30) so I thought it might be good to produce a bit of a shorter video to briefly show you what 100 hours of drawing and painting physically looks like as what is the key lessons I learned so far this 
[00:40](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=40) video won't be covering painting only drawing and the reason for that is just that I've spent the vast majority of this first 100 hours drawing and so while I can think of paint related 
[00:49](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=49) lessons I have learned I want to wait until I have a bit more experience before sharing those with you the next thing to know is that all 100 of these hours were produced working from cards 
[00:58](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=58) in the anky decks I have made made and each session was 1 hour in length I'll break this down as they apply to the skill pillars I work when drawing at the moment which are form and Technical 
[01:08](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=68) skill this is something that the main two books I have been using really drive home that would be how to draw by Scott Robertson and drawing form and pose by Tom Fox everything we draw must be in 
[01:20](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=80) XYZ space meaning it works in 3D perspective no drawing flat shapes here every line you draw should be aimed as an imaginary point in space and you think of the p paper as a 3D Volume you 
[01:31](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=91) drawing into like a sculptor the biggest lesson here particularly when working on Anatomy is that if everything fits inside a box which it does you will only ever be able to see one to three sides 
[01:42](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=102) of it for example if the box is headon we see it as a square if we rotate either the box or our Viewpoint relative to it we might now see two sides each receding into perspective change it 
[01:53](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=113) again and we can now see three sides but we can never see more than three this helps us because whenever we draw say a we can consider before drawing it how far rotated it is and whether we are 
[02:04](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=124) above or below it as well as whether or not it is tilted relative to us can we see under the chin well then we'll not be drawing the top of the head when drawing from life you can quickly check 
[02:13](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=133) the head as if it were a cube and figure out which planes are visible this little consideration of eye level and perspective alignment is very much at the Forefront of my attention when 
[02:22](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=142) drawing for these first 100 hours and I see no sign of that ever changing to make it easier to learn I've been drawing shapes in 2D and aligning them in 3D so that we can break an object 
[02:32](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=152) down into three sectional planes we can then connect up the silhouette of each plane and we have a convincing object in 3D this works for anything you could ever want to draw especially from 
[02:42](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=162) imagination and there is no shame in planning a drawing this way to help you wrap your brain around how the form of something works in fact I suspect it is the key to being able to remember how to 
[02:51](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=171) draw things from imagination another thing that really is almost like a drawing hack should any exist is simply overlapping things by just drawing one object behind another the brain just 
[03:01](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=181) accepts that this must be 3D space and so indicating overlap in your drawings is very useful and should be done wherever it is appropriate I will even now sometimes change a reference pose 
[03:10](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=190) slightly to make the overlap more apparent overlap can be with big forms like arms in front of legs but also in your Silhouettes like the way one muscle is sitting in front of another and how 
[03:19](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=199) they wrap together Under the Skin this is something that's hard to indicate with line and no value but a little nicked line of overlap tricks our brains into understanding it overlap can 
[03:28](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=208) sometimes be confusing so treat it as a secret spice to be used in the right context where it will help and not hinder the understanding of form for the viewer finally I can see the importance 
[03:39](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=219) of not including too much information in your drawings we do not need to see every muscle or every mechanical detail and indeed the art is more interesting when you leave the detail out I'll talk 
[03:48](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=228) about this more in a future video because I now believe there is a whole sliding scale of simplification and a lot of your drawing style will be dictated by the level of Simplicity your 
[03:56](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=236) drawings Express this does not mean that we do not understand understand the form and all its Exquisite detail just that we understand it and choose to simplify it expressing it in far less detailed 
[04:06](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=246) terms when drawing this makes it more of a suggestion of the form than an accurate depiction of the form itself go look at your faith paintings or drawings and you will suddenly be awakened to how 
[04:15](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=255) prolifically this is used in good art let's talk about the technical skill pillar and how my actual skill with drawing tools has evolved in these first 100 hours when I write I hold a pen 
[04:26](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=266) wrong using that term annoys me as there should be no correct way to hold a pen you would assume but I remember in my early school years the teachers telling me off because I held a pen like this 
[04:36](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=276) they used to put a trying get a sleeve over the pen to make me hold it more like this but eventually one teacher said you know what bro you do you or words to that effect and so this is how 
[04:46](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=286) I write the issue is it's also how I draw when you grip the pen that close to the business end it means your line control will be very precise but sometimes that Precision does not help 
[04:56](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=296) the drawing as a result I've been trying to hold the pen pencil in a manner I normally do finger wise but further up the barrel this means I do not have as much control over the lines although I 
[05:06](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=306) am getting better at it I noticed it's something that Kim jungi does which is why I thought I would try it and so far it's been an interesting experiment it definitely adds a slightly shaky more 
[05:15](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=315) fluid quality to the line work and I think I prefer that over trying to be super precise and making sure every line is executed perfectly one other thing it highlighted though was how different 
[05:24](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=324) pens and paper work together I like to draw a ballpoint pen and for most of these 100 hours I've been using different brands of ballpoint pen on layout paper layout paper is cheap 
[05:33](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=333) lowquality paper and it's slightly see-through it's designed for Rapid sketching and then overlaying a fresh sheet on top to redefine the sketch underneath problem with ballpoint pens 
[05:42](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=342) is that they can skid on the surface which is not always great for drawing also the ballpoint pens can drop a big glob of ink at random moments and ruin the line Scott Robertson mentions this 
[05:51](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=351) issue in his book and so copying him I use a tissue or cotton rag to wipe the nib of the pen occasionally closer to the end of these first 100 hours I switched to a fine liner having just 
[05:59](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=359) tried one because it was to hand and I actually preferred the way it works you see holding the pen further up the barrel makes it skid more because I have less control and it's just too much with 
[06:08](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=368) ballpoint at least on smooth papers but the fine liner must have slightly more friction because it skids less and it strikes a better balance between precision and fluidity and line quality 
[06:17](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=377) when holding the pen further up the barrel if I switch to a toothier paper I expect the ballpoint pen would work better so I'll experiment with that at some point in the future too I burned 
[06:25](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=385) through two A3 layout pads one side only in the first 100 hours as well as getting most of the the way through an A4 sized regular paper drawing pad having high quality paper and pens is 
[06:34](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=394) important for doing a good job and I feel it's worth experimenting with a variety to see what you have the best results with other tools I've used include this pilot gtec pen which 
[06:42](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=402) creates a very precise line but it's also very thin and it makes for quite weak lines as well as this Pentel fude brush pen which you have to squeeze slightly to load with a set amount of 
[06:50](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=410) ink if you squeeze it a lot it floods the paper you can also let the ink run out to produce very dry brush style marks if you have any drawing tools or paper Brands you recommend I'd love to 
[06:59](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=419) hear them so that I can try them out so please let me know in the comments there's one more interesting lesson I have learned that is outside of the skill pillars and it really relates to 
[07:07](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=427) my own self-awareness and how I choose to train every day I typically train for 1 hour a day and each session focuses on usually a single idea as defined by the card I am studying I would typically 
[07:17](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=437) train whatever quality a card would emphasize such as Simplicity or XYZ space however I've recently found good opportunities to combine my focus this is something that's only really come 
[07:27](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=447) into my awareness during the latter part of these 100 100 hours and so I'm assuming that my brain has figured out how to spin multiple plates at once what do I mean by that well you may be 
[07:36](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=456) familiar with my Ronaldo analogy where I say that he's so good at dribbling a football that during a game he can forget about doing it and focus on things going on around him a new but 
[07:46](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=466) football would spend so much time worrying about keeping the ball at their feet that they would not be able to concentrate on anything else and in the early stages of learning to draw this is 
[07:53](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=473) what I have experienced I was worrying about keeping the lines as singular non-scratchy marks and trying to spin all these other plates at the same time like being fluid and rhythmic and also 
[08:03](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=483) keeping the lines tight and having strong anatomy and perspective and quite frankly something has to give you will not be able to do all of these things at once as a beginner when drawing it takes 
[08:13](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=493) a while to really internalize a quality but then you can add it to the drawing session without having to worry about it consciously as a result I can now draw Anatomy while being really conscious of 
[08:22](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=502) say the XYZ aspect of what I'm doing and when an opportunity to indicate overlap appears I see it like an opening in a football or boxing match instead of having to dedicate an entire 
[08:31](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=511) session to a single quality I can work multiple qualities at once and I feel this is something you see the far more experienced artists that you admire doing when they draw everything is in 
[08:41](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=521) there as a reflex just doing its thing the perspective is correct the anatomy is well understood and so they can draw fluidly and rhythmically and create really wonderful pieces of art I 
[08:50](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=530) obviously still have a long way to go but I've gained an appreciation of how this idea of spinning multiple plates will become easier over time and I look forward to seeing how that idea 
[08:58](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=538) progresses with my experience hopefully you can see that I have improved at least a little over these first 100 hours and even if the work does not show it that much mentally my understanding 
[09:07](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=547) is way way further along than it was back in December when I started doing this at some point I'll produce a video covering this in more detail but there are socalled new gains happening here 
[09:17](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=557) when starting a new skill or learning undertaking you make the most progress in the earliest phase as I get more into this I'll have to work harder to break new ground and avoid plateauing but I'll 
[09:27](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=567) be in this newb phas for a while and so I'll be enjoy big leaps of knowledge and understanding I hope the main thing you take away from this video is the self-awareness I have when I'm drawing I 
[09:35](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=575) notice how my body and ability and focus changes over time and I document it that's what meta learning is all about learning how you personally learn so that you can create experiments and 
[09:45](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=585) explore what works and what doesn't the other thing to note is that I'm not working specific techniques but focusing on more abstract generic principles and qualities I do not really care much 
[09:55](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=595) about head Anatomy right now but rather can I draw a box in perspective well I have to walk before I can run and you're far better off training these broad generic qualities so they can be applied 
[10:04](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=604) to all your future Arts do your foundational work and then get more specific thanks for watching hopefully there was something useful to you in there I'll be back soon with my video on 
[10:13](https://youtu.be/dV5wkFM59WQ?si=y2d3ThJz4xicq8PI&t=613) art books and so I'll hopefully see you then

Picking colours for Comic Book Covers! I walk you thought my process for choosing the colors on three different covers I did recently. As well as walk you through the steps and process in the original files.

Understanding and applying color theory can seem overwhelming with terms like complementary, primary, and split tertiary color schemes. I simplify these concepts in my work, focusing on practical application rather than just theory. This video walks through the process of creating three comic covers, demonstrating how simple, reliable color schemes can be effectively applied.

For each cover, I start with a rough thumbnail, progressing to a more refined stage before considering color. The goal is always to create a strong visual impact, often achieved through monochromatic schemes that stand out among other images. I share how I navigate the choices imposed by the characters' inherent colors and the story's demands, leaning into simplicity and harmony.

Simplify Color Theory: Emphasize the application of simple color schemes over complex theoretical knowledge. Practical use is more important than memorizing terms.

Color and Story Connection: Make color choices that support the narrative. The character's inherent colors and the story's themes should guide the color scheme decisions.

Keep it Graphic and Bold: Aiming for a simple, graphic look can make covers more eye-catching. This often involves embracing bold colors and straightforward compositions.

Happy Drawing!

In this full-process video we'll be modeling, adding materials, lighting, and animating a pair of headphones in Blender 3D. There are tons of tips and tricks in here during all parts of the process including intermediate topology, subsurface workflows, cloth simulation, bump mapping, texturing, procedural textures, product lighting, product presentation, and more. 

This video is aimed at people who are not totally new to 3D software but with patience and dedication can be completed by people at the beginner level. If you are interested in product animation, product design, industrial design, etc then this video is for YOU! 

Have fun and share your results with me!

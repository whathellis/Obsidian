(Description:: In this free tutorial we'll be going through how to make stunning foliage using only the built in tools in Blender. No tricks, no paid addons, just good ol' Blender!)

We'll cover everything you see on screen which includes
 - Modeling our bases
 - Scattering using particles
 - Tweaking our scatters with Vertex Groups
 - Simple and advanced lighting with HDRIs
 - Realistic foliage shaders
 - Camera setup

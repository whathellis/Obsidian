(Description:: In this Cinema 4D tutorial we'll go over a few ways to use the Z-Depth pass beyond the classic Depth-of-Field blur. I've been using a lot of these techniques in different projects throughout the years and I felt like sharing them. These techniques can work with a z-depth pass from any rendering engine, and on any post-compositing software. I'll be using After Effects.)

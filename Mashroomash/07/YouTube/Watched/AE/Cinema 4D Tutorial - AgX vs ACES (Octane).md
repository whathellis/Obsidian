(Description:: Everybody's talking about ACES, but it's not the only way to go when it comes to color-management. AgX (by Troy Sobotka) is producing amazing results, and unlike ACES which exists in it's own color-space, AgX is transforming your tones and gamut directly to sRGB. There's a strong argument that AgX is actually superior to ACES, especially in CGI, and in this tutorial, I'll show you the differences between the two workflows, so you can be the judge yourself. )

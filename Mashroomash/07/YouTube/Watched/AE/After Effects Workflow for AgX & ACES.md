(Description:: As mentioned in the previous video, working with EXRs in a linear workflow is the only way you want to go when it comes to post-compositing. We learned how to work with AgX and ACES inside Cinema 4D & Octane, and this time we'll look into how to continue this workflow into After Effects, where you might do your post-compositing. The first part of the video will show the process in the previous AE versions, and at the end of the video we look at how to do it in the newest AE update. It's simpler than you think!)

(Description:: In this video we look at a new rendering feature in the upcoming Blender 4.0 that deals with color management. Blender 4.0 is gaining a better view transform function called AgX which is more sophistical than Filmic. That's what this video discusses. Both Filmic and AgX functions were developed by Troy James Sobotka.)

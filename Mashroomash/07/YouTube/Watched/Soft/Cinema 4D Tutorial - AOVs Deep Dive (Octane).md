(Description:: Today we'll go over (almost) every single AOV in Octane, how it looks like, and what it does. This information is relevant to any rendering engine really, since AOVs are commonly used by many 3d apps. )
Bringing AOVs into your workflow can help you fine-tune your renders to get an even more impressive look than your basic beauty render, help speed up your work by allowing very extensive post-compositing editing, and can help you quickly identify possible issues in specific channels by being able to isolate them.

# Transcript
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=0) hello everyone and welcome to another video in this channel my name is Abraham little and I'm super happy to be sharing with you this technique right here today we're going to be going over a 
[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=9) procedurally generated hand-painted style texture inside of substance painter this is a texture that you can very easily build and reuse for multiple assets that allows you to control very 
[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=19) easily all of the things right here let me show you real quick before we jump onto the main uh like process that we're going to be doing right here so in this like little layer right here all of 
[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=29) these layers I'm going to be showing you how we build these layers and we go from a very very flat skin such as this one right here to a very nice effect with all of this color and Hue variations 
[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=39) this allows us again to go from a very very like super simple model to a very nice and complex shape in a matter of 30 minutes and you can save this material as a smart material and reduce it for 
[00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=52) any and as many characters as you want so if you find this tutorials useful by the end of that please make sure to subscribe and follow us so that you can help us go grow and continue sharing 
[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=61) with you all of those amazing tricks let's go we have here our character and we're ready to start with our hand-painted process so first we need to make sure 
[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=70) that we have our bakes ready as you can see all of my elements are here it's no longer finding the element but I have all of my bakes ready it's a 2K texture which is again usually what you would 
[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=80) normally use for a game and yes there are a couple of issues for instance here on the eyes you can see there's a little bit of anti-aliasing but usually with hand painted texture you can hide a lot 
[01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=88) of the stuff very very easily now the first thing I want to do is I want to divide the from the body so I'm going to go here to my layers and I'm going to create a new field layer I'm just going 
[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=99) to grab like a very basic green color and as you guys know we're going to be working with hand painted textures so this means that we're not actually going to have any roughness any like 
[01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=107) information on the material it's just going to be a flat color that's going to look very very nice so over here I'm going to press alt and color so that we get everything else except for color but 
[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=116) actually I'm going to add a layer at the very bottom I'm gonna call this my roughness layer and this roughness layer is going to have everything except for or it's going to have roughness and 
[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=125) nothing else and we're going to bring the roughness all the way up so now every time we build something on top this layer is kind of pretty much like override everything you can have this on 
[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=132) the top as well and it will just override the roughness of whatever you have underneath so for instance if we weren't back to this one and we turn on the roughness back up nothing's going to 
[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=140) change because this one is just overwhelming everything else now for performance sake we do want to keep this low this is going to be my let's call this a base 
[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=149) the skin and then I'm going to right click or I'm just going to control G to add a new group and I'm going to Black Mask this group I'm going to press number four and 
[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=157) I'm going to go to my polygon fill and select the element right here as you can see that selects everything on my character I'm gonna change this folder name to skin and we're going to do the 
[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=167) exact same thing with the teeth and the eyes there we go so now that we have one group for each of the elements we can start working on the layers that are going to make the actual elements and 
[02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=176) I'm going to be using one of my methods which is to create or use a basic primary colors to give more depth to the whole character a very good advice that I'm going to give you right now is we're 
[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=186) going to be working on the C tap so if you press the letter c on your keyboard you're gonna jump into the channels and this is going to allow you to see the texture as a flat texture because even 
[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=194) though we don't have any roughness when we go into material mode which is the letter M we're still going to see some light and some Shadow information and you always want to be able to jump 
[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=202) between these two to really appreciate how the hand-painted effect is going to be happening so let's start by adding a little bit of depth to my character I'm gonna add a new female layer this is 
[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=212) going to be my like a dark colorful layer and I'm going to sample the exact same color as I have above but I'm gonna move it a little bit more towards like the blue colors and make it a little bit 
[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=222) darker usually I like to go all the way to like the purples but in this case I'm going to keep it like this sort of like desaturated blue and this one of course is going to be 
[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=230) right here on top let's bring back our grain like basic color one very like important thing about the hand painted textures is you always want to keep your tones Close to the center 
[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=240) of the color here you don't want to push them to the extremes because it's very difficult to build on top of that once you go to this extreme to this like super bright green there's no going back 
[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=250) so we're gonna keep it let's say roughly around here like a mid Hue value right around there now on this base skin we're going to add a black mask and we're going to be adding a generator and we're 
[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=260) going to add of course a dirt generator this dirt generator is going to occupy all of the dirt sections of my character which is going to give me a very very nice effect and here's where we're going 
[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=270) to start doing the magic all of this again I want to show you how to do this process it's going to be procedural so at the very end we're going to be able to save this skin as a smart material 
[04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=278) and use it how many times we want it's of course not going to give you like the exact result that you would find in games such as water worker for the Legends where there's a lot of like hand 
[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=286) like actual hand-painted stuff but it's going to get you very very close and it's going to give you a nice result so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to set this to something like a 
[04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=294) multiply or in this case I think maybe overlay not really actually Gonna Keep it normal because I want to have a little bit of that blue hue but I'm going to bring the intensity or the 
[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=304) opacity a little bit down to something like a 75 and as you can see it looks very dirty very rough so one of the things that we can do is we can add another filter here and we can add a 
[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=314) blur filter and the blue filter will soften out everything else it's going to blend everything very very nicely let's go back to our material mode and you can see how this layer is already giving us 
[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=323) a lot of depth on our character I think I'm even going to bring this a little bit more down right around there and one of the things that I personally really like about hand paint the texture is the 
[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=333) fact that sometimes you get this sort of like paint brush effect on certain areas and we can add that if we go over here and we add another filter we can add something called a blur slope and the 
[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=343) blur slope as you can see it's gonna give me this very like intense blur on the borders of the element and if we increase the intensity of course it's going to be even like more or less so 
[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=352) I'm going to keep the intensity relatively low but what I'm going to do is I'm gonna use the divider and the 10 or maybe even like a hundred I think 10 was fine so that we don't 
[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=363) have like those like super sharp corners and you can see again if we go to the C mode then we get this very like painterly sort of like interesting effect I kind of want to go to a hundred 
[06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=373) actually to make this a little bit smaller and let's bring the intensity a little bit up there we go and look at the difference we have between the blur and 
[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=383) the slow blur I wish we had a little bit more options because I feel like a 50 would be a little bit better but in this case I think we're gonna have to keep it roughly around at there 
[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=392) there we go so this as you can see it's going to give us a very very nice like effect on the whole thing so that blue color that we added those are our shadows pretty much if you want to you 
[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=403) can either increase the blur or you can even go here to the blur slope and reduce the amount so for instance I was saying that it was a little bit too obvious here on the ears right there so 
[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=411) we can smooth this out and get again a nicely painterly effect for the whole thing now we're going to be adding some uh life into our character we're going to 
[07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=420) add a little bit of color so I'm gonna add a new field layer and in this case again I'm going to remove all of the colors and we're going to be adding a red color again not super intense I'm 
[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=428) actually going to go to like the orange colors or something like this and I'm going to add a black mask in this one I am going to be using a a feel layer so that we can hit the ambient occlusion of 
[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=441) the character okay sorry the thickness of the character because we want to use this to bring a little bit of blood into the things that are usually a little bit thinner so I'm going to use a fill layer 
[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=450) and on this fill layer on the grayscale I'm going to look for its thickness layer and as you can see the thickness layer goes to every single point of the character except on the thin areas what 
[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=459) can we do here we can actually invert this with a levels filter we're going to invert this and we're going to get this very nice effect look at how it looks like it's a little like so like it's 
[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=468) like a fake subsurface pass on the whole character and by doing this we get a little bit more life into it I do think that this orange is a little bit too orange so I'm going to go a little bit 
[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=477) more towards the red colors there we go and one of the cool things is we can go to the levels and right now you can see that the levels are really pushed towards the white colors if we start 
[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=485) pushing this we're going to be able to bring more color everywhere else or we can move some of this stuff up as you can see this also going to give me a little bit of this red color everywhere 
[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=494) on the character which gives it I believe a little bit more life now on this one I'm also going to be adding another filter and this is of course going to be a blur slope filter to break 
[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=504) up the elements a little bit more let's change this to in the intensity of 10 and bring the intensity down let's press the letter c so that we can appreciate how this blur slope is breaking up our 
[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=514) elements a little bit right there or maybe a little bit more intensity and very importantly you whenever you add a color and whenever you're working with something here inside of substance you 
[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=525) always want to blend between things because if you just let something sit on top of every or something else like in this case this color right here it's going to look very fake 
[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=533) so for things where I want to add colors we're going to be using these options right here the linear Dodge or the multiply stuff like that multiply in this case of course is not going to work 
[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=541) linear Dodge is usually going to give us a nice result you can even go to something like a sign Edition that was not good let's try the linear burn not really 
[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=552) divide nope introduction's looking like the best one and in this particular case I am going to increase the intensity a little bit more so that we get more color and then if we need to we can of 
[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=563) course like bring the opacity down a little bit so we can get the greens back again but look at how nice we're building the skin from just a very basic color to a shadow and a nice effect 
[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=573) right here and we're already generating this very cool effect and if we go to the seek tab you're going to start seeing the force of the character being like produced or being like rendered on 
[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=584) the skin itself now we're going to add one more pass which is going to give us a little bit of more contrast overall so this one let's call actually let's change some of the names here 
[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=595) this is going to be base skin just let's call this a skid it's going to be our shadows and this is going to be our lights so far it's the first light pass 
[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=607) that we have I'm gonna add another field layer and in this color we're gonna go for a dark purple color something like this I'm going to add a black mask in this black mask we're going to be using 
[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=618) a b into cushion because usually areas that don't get as much light are going to be a little bit darker so I'm going to be using a field layer and on this field layer we're going to look now for 
[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=627) the amp intercollution map and of course we're going to go to the levels we're going to add the levels and we're going to invert this so we get this very nice dark effects we go to the 
[10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=637) C layer you can see how much this layer helps to really like create a little bit more contrast I'm going to push a little bit more aggressively here because I want to catch some of the like crevices 
[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=647) and wrinkles of the character and now I'm gonna go back to the color right here probably gonna give a little bit more color something like this and of course if we go to a multiply effect or 
[10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=657) an overlay effect we're going to be able to get this a very nice red tone on top of the whole character it's definitely a little bit dark so I'm gonna bring it down a little bit so it's not as dark 
[11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=666) and what we can do is we can saturate a little bit more to get a little bit more of this sort of like pinkish Hue on top of the character there we go now of course we can add another filter 
[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=677) here for instance a blur slope and uh change this again to like a 10. and that's going to give us a very very nice effect it's kind of like a war paint sort of effect if you feel like 
[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=688) this being a little bit too much remember at any point we can lower the overlay and this is the fun thing about this process in particular is the fact that by building this layer by layer 
[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=696) we're able to generate something that we can change at any point without having to like paint everything again it's again not as precise as other methods but it's going to give you a very nice 
[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=706) flexibility and since we're not painting anything if I just grab this a skin a smart material and drop it into someone else and some other character I can just change the colors I'm going to get the 
[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=715) exact same effect so imagine we're doing like a troll and we want to change the skin to a blue skin we literally just go to the blue skin we change the colors and we're gonna get the exact same 
[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=724) effect so this is one of the big strengths of the of this new workflows where everything's like um a procedural and stuff so there we go that that one's looking nice I like the the general 
[12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=735) effect on this thing now we're gonna add a little bit of highlight on some of the high points of the element so I'm going to go over here I'm going to add a new layer and we're going to sample the 
[12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=745) exact color that we have on the previous skin which is this one right here and with this sample that we have right here I'm gonna go a little bit lighter and a little bit higher higher on the value so 
[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=755) it's going to be a light light green I'm gonna add a black mask and we're going to be using a generator and in this case we're going to be using the metal edgeware so it's going to hit all of the 
[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=763) high points and this is going to act as sort of like a like a glossy effect on the high points of our character the only thing we need to do here is of course add a filter and play with a blur 
[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=774) slope for instance let's change this in this case I'm not doing the blur I'm just going directly into this one because we're going to be setting this to linear Dodge so that the color gets 
[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=782) really really intense we're gonna really bring this down okay and after the blur slope we can add a little blur blur like normal blur there we go so see 
[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=794) how nice this highlight looks on top of the like the thin areas of her character this is a very very cool effect that we can get on our character another thing we can do here and this is a little bit 
[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=804) more advanced but it's not that difficult to understand is uh I'm gonna press alt and click on the mask so that we can see what the mask is doing and you can see that right now we got the 
[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=813) metal Edge where we get the blue slope we got the blur and now I'm gonna add another generator this is going to be a position generator and the position generator is a gradient and in this case 
[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=822) it's going from top to bottom I'm gonna change the global balance so that we are affecting more on the top of the head right around there let's do a little bit more blur 
[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=831) and then what I can do is I can multiply this against everything else and now what's happening is only on the areas where the position is actually acting is where we're going to be getting this a 
[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=840) very like interesting highlight so see the difference between no position and position so we're removing some of the stuff that we have down here on the chest area and it's giving us or should 
[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=850) give us a little bit more of a nice effect on the character so this is pretty much it for the base of the skin usually there's one more layer that I'd like to ask and that's 
[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=860) another soft surface layer so I'm gonna go for a very bright red in this case and this one is going to be using the thickness map again so I'm going to add a fill layer and we're going to be using 
[14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=870) the thickness map of our element or our object there we go we're of course gonna do a levels and we're gonna invert these levels and this is gonna give us as you 
[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=880) can see a very nice linear Dodge or a surface like a fixed surface I'm gonna set this to linear Dodge and of course I'm gonna bring this down I usually set this to like a 20 or something like that 
[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=889) because otherwise it becomes a little bit too intense and you can play here depending on how how like a live or not you want the object to look and now take a look at this if we go to Z mode which 
[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=899) is our our color mode our color map the texture is looking very very nice we're building something that's looking quite quite nice let's keep going the next one that I'm 
[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=909) going to add and this is going to be the final one here on the skin section before we jump into the light section is a cavity effect so I'm going to add a new uh like a layer right here near 
[15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=918) color layer and this is going to be like a dark purple again something like this quite saturated I would say let's call this cavity we're going to add a black mask we're going to 
[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=928) add a few layer and we're going to look for the cavity mask the cavity mask is though or in this case it's called the curvature mask the curvature mask is the one that we usually use for things such 
[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=939) as the wrinkles and things like that it's a it's a mask that's just quite a bit by generators and we're going to add the levels right here and we're going to invert this mask so look at that if we 
[15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=948) start crunching this as you can see we can generate a very very nice interesting effect where only the wrinkles like the inner wrinkles of the character are being filled by this 
[15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=959) effect and this is especially important because if we go to the color information it's going to give us a lot of depth this one of course we're going to set to an overlay 
[16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=968) ah overlay or multiply it's pretty much the same and we're gonna definitely give it a small little blur so I'm going to add another filter here and let's use a blur slope this one I'm definitely going 
[16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=981) to increase to like a hundred so the blur slope is not as intense there we go and you can see how this kind of kind of like Paints the the cavities on our character and of course 
[16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=991) we're gonna bring this down a little bit because we don't want to overwhelm our colors but look at how nice the whole like structure and whole construction of our character is going and again the 
[16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1000) cool thing about this is if at any point you feel like things are like way too light or way too uh bright you can just change things so for instance I feel like the skin is a little bit too 
[16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1009) saturated so I'm gonna bring the color down a little bit more towards the yellows or maybe towards the blues and I can make all of these changes procedurally 
[16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1019) without having to repaint anything I'm I'm wondering out this lights these lights are very very aggressive so I'm gonna bring them down a little bit so we get more of this like traditional green 
[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1029) orc effect there we go now we're going to jump onto the next section which is going to be the light section I'm gonna repeat this process with the teeth just like High Point slow points and stuff 
[17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1039) like that and again all procedural but it's pretty much the same thing that we did with the skin I just don't want to bore you guys with all of the process and then we'll jump into the light 
[17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1051) very well so as you can see we got the teeth ready right here it's just a very basic highlight thickness and and dirt effect which is giving us a little bit of texture here's where for instance 
[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1061) since the teeth are smaller and you might not want to do a personalized like effect for the teeth you could manually paint certain elements so let's say we added a new field layer right here and 
[17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1071) it's going to be like a very like dark layer we can add a black mask and if we go for a brush we can just grab any like brush right here paint a little bit of like dark areas underneath the teeth 
[18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1083) something like this okay just keep in mind that this is not going to be able to be procedural like you're going to have to paint this on every single character and then we can 
[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1093) add of course a filter and let's add our blur slope play a little bit with the with the effect right there and change this to 10. and changes to something like a 
[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1103) multiply and really bring this down so that gives us a little bit more like depth on the teeth without having to do all of the work now let's talk about the light information before we jump onto 
[18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1115) the final part which is going to be the the eyes I'm going to add a new information here a new layer and what I want to do is I want to paint the Shadows of the object so if we go to a 
[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1124) base color layer right here I'm gonna go for a really like warm or not non-war I'm actually gonna go for a cool sort of like Shadow like a blue shadow and I'm going to add a black mask and we're 
[18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1135) going to be using a very important generator which is called a light generator and the light generator what it does it shines a virtual light into the object and the places where that 
[19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1144) light hits the object we're going to get this sort of effect the cool thing is we can move this around and as you can see I can make the light hit the object from below so now if I do 
[19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1154) that and we change the glossiness and things like that we're going to be incorporating the sort of like gradient like dark gradient hitting our object from Below on all of the areas that you 
[19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1163) will normally expect the light to be hitting for instance if we bring the light determination all the way down we're going to get this very very interesting effect if we could do the 
[19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1171) material this might be a little bit too much but I'm going to keep it for now I'm going to multiply and look how much more like depth we get on the character like it looks very contrasty right now 
[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1180) but now we're going to add the cool one which is or actually the the main light which is going to be our warm light I'm gonna go for the sort of like a nice warm light right here let's make it a 
[19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1191) little bit warmer and we're gonna do the exact same thing a black mask right click we're gonna add a few layer and this is going to be sorry not feel layer a generator 
[20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1201) and this is going to be a light generator that's going to be hitting the top of my character right there and we're gonna set this to linear Dodge so it multiplies the color so it's like if 
[20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1210) we're painting the character with light into our scene now of course this one is very aggressive so we need to to bring it down a little bit kind of want to add a little bit more color to it so let's 
[20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1221) go back to the elements right here there we go something like that and one of the things that we can do that I really like about this is we can change the attenuation so it's only hitting as 
[20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1231) you can see the top parts of the character we can change the Highlight glossiness I'm gonna make the glossiness a little bit less intense we can increase the 
[20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1238) Highlight level there we go and of course on top of this we can add another filter such as our blur slope that we've been using so far let's do 100 right there 
[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1250) or actually 10. and play around with this effect right here maybe leaner Dutch is not the best let's try 
[21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1260) overlay or leaner burn overlay was looking quite nice actually there we go there we are because it's really saturating the highlights of her character and look at how nice the the 
[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1272) light effect now hitting our character looks and again if we go to the C mode which is just a flat color no light information or anything this already looks quite quite nice as well 
[21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1282) so yeah that's pretty much it for the skin the last thing that I normally add after my my lats and my Shadows is just a very basic AP interclusion pass so we're gonna be using a few layer here 
[21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1294) this one I usually do keep it to a dark color like a very like dark red for instance I'm gonna add a black mask right click add another fill layer in this field layer we're going to be 
[21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1305) looking for the ambient occlusion and of course since the immigration is usually inverted we need to add eight levels invert this effect and look at that we get this very like strong shadow 
[21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1316) of course you want to like multiply this and play a little bit with intensity depending on how Intense or not you want how contrasty you want your effect uh someone in the comments was asking me if 
[22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1325) we could do like a like a borderline sort of like Shader I I'm not a Shader expert so I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that soon but maybe later however this is a very sort of like 
[22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1334) comic book style again hand-painted effect that you can get very very quickly look at this now the difference between the Shaded mode and d and the material mode as you can see it's not 
[22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1344) that much this is my color mode this is shaded mode and you can see that the change is very very very light the only thing that's changes is a little bit of extra Shadows that we get here on the 
[22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1353) world and you could even add those if you add another like uh like if we add another contrast layer here and we go to the levels and we just make this like very very Punchy like we go for like all 
[22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1364) of the main crevices but we should be able to get really close there we go really close to the main area right here so that's the material 
[22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1375) and that's the color another thing you can do another one right here and change the the light information so that it's affecting less area and that way we're 
[23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1386) building layers so every layer we build is another little like a highlight that we can add to the character in a very nice effect this one I actually really like I'm just going to bring the light 
[23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1395) attenuation down so we can get a little bit more light down here if you want this is not something that I recommend for this procedural material but if you want 
[23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1405) another thing you can do is you can add a paint layer bring this paint layer down so I'm gonna move effect down for the blur slope and then if you paint specific areas you can 
[23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1418) highlight you can add a little bit more highlight on specific areas of your character that you might want to do I don't have my tablet with me right now but if I had I could like soften that up 
[23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1428) a little bit more but this is another way in which you can add and paint like certain lights on the model however this is going to be model dependent so certain models will benefit from this 
[23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1438) and other models won't so you're gonna have to like manually adjust this sort of effect in this particular case I like to use my uh like a a softer brush such as this like 
[24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1449) artistic brush and again we can add and remove a little bit of highlight in specific areas of the character depending on how we how we want to like portray this this 
[24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1462) particular effect that's looking quite nice so the last thing that we need to do is the eyes we're going to jump now onto the eyes and we're going to be using a very very cool technique here 
[24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1472) again if you feel like this are a little bit too dark feel free to just like tone them down and play a little bit with the other highlights other colors but this material right here should give you a 
[24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1481) very very nice effect very very fast like we've been only working on this for 25 minutes around 25 minutes and um and it should be looking quite nice already so yeah let's now go to the eyes 
[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1491) so there's two ways in which we can do the eyes the first one is to literally go here into substance go into our eyes layer right here add a paint layer instead of a normal layer you can even 
[25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1502) add like um Symmetry and everything and just literally start painting your eye like manually that's a that's a way to do it however I'm not an illustrator I don't 
[25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1512) know how to do eyes normally so we're going to be using some eye textures and if we look for hand-painted eyes you're gonna find eyes that are looking quite nice you can actually follow some of 
[25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1521) these tutorials that are really good tutorials out there on how to paint your eyes and um but if not we can just like try to look for a eye texture and use that as our base inside of substance so 
[25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1534) a lot of these textures that you're going to find about eyes are actually hand painted some of them of course are realistic or photographed there's a lot of hand-painted stuff and we can 
[25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1543) literally take any of these images and paint them on our paint layer and then work on top of them to add a little bit more variation so for instance this one right here is looking quite nice I've 
[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1552) actually used some of this before uh this one's not that bad that one looks good one of the things that I recommend when they were looking for this kind of textures is always look 
[26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1561) for a texture that has no color information in it well or sorry no light information so this one right here looks very very cool and it has a nice resolution I do want to change the Hue 
[26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1571) of the eye so that it's a ref so I'm gonna have to do that inside the Photoshop before we bring it this into substance you could potentially do it in substance but it's a little bit more 
[26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1579) complicated I don't want to make it difficult for you guys so let's open a new file right here oh there's new yeah there's new stuff here instead of uh I'll probably do a 
[26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1590) video about the new stuff inside of inside of Photoshop so here very simply I'm just going to grab my elliptical marquito select the eye right there hit Ctrl U and just change the saturation or 
[26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1603) the Hue to like a red one like a red color and increase the saturation a little bit probably bring the lightness a little bit down and there we go even that like blue 
[26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1612) looks nice so I'm gonna save this image in my desktop it's a JPEG image let's just call this I and we're going to bring that into a substance now I'm going to change the 
[27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1623) view here to an orthographic view so that everything is perfectly flat and we don't have like crossed eyes or anything we're going to go over here and we need to drag and drop from our desktop our 
[27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1633) eye texture over here we're going to Define this as a texture and I just want this on my project so far so once I have that and I'm in a paint layer inside of the layer section I'm going to go to 
[27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1645) projection mode which is this one right here and down over here on the properties of the projection itself I just want to be painting the color information and here in the color 
[27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1655) information I'm just going to drop my base color and this is going to become a stencil so I'm going to press s and scale this down so that this fits right where the eye is supposed to be which is 
[27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1664) right around there and if I paint as you can see we're going to be painting the eyes for our org just like that now that we have that that looks good but it can look a little 
[27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1674) bit better and this is where again doing a little bit of like traditional painting is going to be is going to be good so the first thing I'm noticing is that there seems to be a a normal map 
[28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1683) problem that's that normal information right there uh technically we could paint the normal but I'm just gonna use that as any excuse to paint with a darker color so I'm going to go to my 
[28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1693) color right here I'm going to go for a very dark color and by going into my brushes again using a soft brush in this case this basic soft 
[28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1702) I'm going to add a little bit of a line kind of like a shadow line right there and once I have that oh God what did I do here let me 
[28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1714) so and this one right here I'm gonna blur it a little bit so I'm gonna go filter and I'm gonna add a blur filter not too much it's a little bit too much just a little bit of a shadow that we 
[28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1726) want to do and actually I do want to have pretty much the same shadow on the top just kind of like the the eyelid like going against the whole thing in this one of course we can go into 
[28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1736) multiply to get a nicer Shadow on top of the eye right there another thing that we normally get this is going to be another paint layer is a little highlight right like you've seen this in 
[29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1746) in games and stuff it's a little like like a little nice white element that makes the eye look glossy so I'm going to add one right there and there's been I've seen some some elements where they 
[29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1755) add like another get another one right here and we're gonna set this to linear Dodge so that they multiply and that's going to give me actually that one I don't 
[29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1765) like as much a little one right here it's got like a like a rim light sort of effect you can go to eraser mode and the problem with this this is not procedural 
[29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1776) because we're gonna have to do this per model or per character it's going to give us a nice effect right there and there we go that's pretty much it the last thing that I would do this is 
[29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1786) uh just based on the personal experience if you already have a a character that's looking quite nice in this sort of hand-painted effect you could add a little bit of variations you could add a 
[29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1796) little bit of color to specific areas but that's going to have to be done on a separate layer at the very top so for instance blood blood is very common I'm just going to add a dark layer right 
[30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1804) here add a black mask we don't need Symmetry and as you guys know we have this like cut right here so we do need to paint the blood but ideally if you've already done 
[30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1814) all of the steps that we've done so far then this was going to be very easy because you can just set this up to an overlay or to a linear Dodge or something and it's going to blend with 
[30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1823) everything else in the worst case scenario just leave it as normal and play a little bit with your opacity so that it doesn't look like as obvious and if you want this to be like fresher 
[30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1831) blood of course we'll need to do a couple more layers and blend some highlights and stuff into it warpaint it's another very common one if you want to do a little bit of a war paint effect 
[30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1840) let's go for like this Saruman White Hand of uh of Doom I'm gonna add a black mask right here and I do believe there is an alpha here which is like a hand yes we have this like hand print I'm 
[30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1854) just going to grab this handprint right here and I'm gonna rotate the stencil to here on the rotation or the angle I'm gonna have it right around there 
[31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1870) there we go and this one of course we can also like multiply or or linear Dodge depending on how we want to blend it and we would need to erase or remove some of the effects here 
[31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1882) on the hand itself so this is all customization on how we want to make things look even better depending on the character that we're going for but it's going to allow us to generate a hand 
[31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1892) paint to the fact look at this again if we go to the C which is the channel this is our like completely flat Albedo if you're doing a game where there is absolutely no light and everything is 
[31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1901) just shaded normally this is what you're going to be seeing and as you can see it's a really really cool result so that's it my friends hopefully you like this video uh this is one of my little 
[31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1910) like hidden techniques I'm gonna see if I can get this model in the resources folder so that you can practice as well and show me in our Discord Channel how you got or what kind of result that you 
[31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1919) got and um yeah if you want to learn anything else about the 3D World then make sure to leave me a comment with more things more topics more elements that you might want to investigate and 
[32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1928) I'll be happy to do some research for you or if I already know how to do it I'll show you in another video here in the YouTube channel we're getting really close to our goal which is 3K 
[32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT5PJKMPTdg&list=WL&index=6&t=1936) subscribers so if you're not subscribed and you like this video please don't forget to do so and that's pretty much it I'm gonna be seeing you back on the next one bye

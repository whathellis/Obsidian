(Description::In this C4D tutorial I'll show you how I rig and animate the hand model we created in the last tutorial. We'll go over how to create a healthy skeleton, how to approach weight painting, and how to create an efficient animation system using the Pose-Morph tag. As a bonus, I'll also show you how to mirror any rig that you have while keeping all the weights.)
Stay tuned for the next part, where we'll be UV unwrapping this model. Don't worry, it's way easier than it sounds!

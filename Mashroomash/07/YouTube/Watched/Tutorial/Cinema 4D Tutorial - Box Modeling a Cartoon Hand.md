(Description:: In this C4D tutorial I'll show you how I model this cute chubby hand using box-modeling technique. We'll go over how I use this technique to achieve a clean and healthy mesh while maintaining style and personality. )
Stay tuned for the next part, where we'll be rigging and animating this model!
And part 3 where we'll go over how to UV unwrap it. It's easier than it sounds.

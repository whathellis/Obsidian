(Description:: In this C4D quick tip I'll show you how to UV unwrap this simple model in the easiest way possible. UV unwrapping is a dreaded but essential part of 3d modeling, which is why it's important to at least understand how to approach it in the most basic way. And this is what I'm showing you here! I use this method on pretty much every model that I have and it works good enough 100% of the time.)

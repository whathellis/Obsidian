In this lengthy video I cover 5 different ways of bringing data to life aka infographics. These types of animations are staples in most videos and are commonly used in videos from Vox, Johnny Harris, Cleo Abrams and many more. This video specifically covers some of my favourite types of infographics: The Phase Animation, The Box Chart, The Pie Chart, The Pyramid, and The Map Animation.

As always, thank you for watching!

This is the Blender part of the tutorial where you will learn how to setup a reference image to the right scale, lowpoly and highpoly creation by making use of various free plugins, modifiers, tools as well as unwrapping our low poly. Once this is done we are getting everything prepared with proper naming convention as well as material ID colors for the bake and texturing part which happens in the Marmoset Toolbag 4 tutorial after this one - you can follow that part by downloading the one month free trial version if you don't have it.) ðŸ‘Œ

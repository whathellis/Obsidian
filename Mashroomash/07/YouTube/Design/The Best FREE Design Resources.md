[00:00](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=0) [Music] today's video is sponsored by squarespace [Music] hi friends welcome back to another video 
[00:15](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=15) today we're going to be talking about my favorite free design resources and as a graphic designer we need a lot of resources at our disposal because we are constantly relying on other assets to 
[00:27](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=27) create our art especially for clients and so i whoop that just kicked my drawers so today we're going to be covering some big categories of assets that i think everybody should have in 
[00:39](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=39) their archive so we're going to be covering stock so we're gonna we're gonna go over like free photo sites free vector sites free illustration sites free video and audio stuff in case you 
[00:51](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=51) guys ever need it we're gonna be covering my favorite frame mock-up sites some amazing places to get free fonts free textures and finally we're going to close with my favorite adobe alternate 
[01:04](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=64) programs so um let's let's go ahead and get started i'm super excited for this one if you're new here if you're watching for the first 
[01:11](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=71) time my name is kell i use they them pronouns and i welcome you to my little design community here on youtube i welcome everyone here and if you want to leave any sort of assets or resources 
[01:20](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=80) that you suggest that i may have left out in this video feel free to leave it down in the comment section below help each other out um so we can make this community much more welcoming 
[01:29](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=89) and we can slowly take down the adobe overlords so the first thing we're gonna be starting off with is stock so this is photos videos vectors icons 
[01:40](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=100) illustrations audio all that jazz so all of the sites i'm about to talk about are safe for um commercial use unless they are otherwise noted in their description so 
[01:52](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=112) as you're going through all of this be sure to check the license saying you don't want to get yourself or your client in some hot water if you did not follow the proper licensing for a photo 
[02:01](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=121) or a video or whatever so it's under the creative commons license so it's a public domain dedication so you can copy modify distribute perform the work even for commercial purposes all without 
[02:14](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=134) asking permission or paying for something so this is really really great especially for like new designers because assets can get really expensive so let's get started my number one go-to 
[02:25](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=145) and it has been for years is unsplash if you are unfamiliar with unsplash this one's it's gained quite a bit of popularity in the past couple years but unsplash is consistently i think one of 
[02:38](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=158) the best stock photo sites that has everything completely free so you can use it for personal use commercial use absolutely free of course if you can credit the photographers do give them 
[02:47](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=167) the exposure that they need but unsplash is an awesome site i've used them since i was in college i use them still to this day they have like a different approach to stock photos because it's 
[02:58](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=178) all like photography it's all sourced from photographers instead of kind of like not like source from photographers what i want to say but the photos just are better than like 
[03:08](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=188) yours regular stock photo site so unsplash continuously amazes me um but i do see some of like the classic unsplash photos overused a little bit too much i know 
[03:20](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=200) when i see a photo in an ad somewhere i'm like i know you got that from one splash but nothing wrong with that i just dig on there for hours on end anyway so unsplash is just for photo the 
[03:32](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=212) next one is pexels.com they have photo and video that are completely royalty free and free for commercial and personal use um their video selection is small but it is still pretty good i 
[03:44](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=224) would say pixels is like a close second to unsplash after that we have pixabay um this one is a photo video illustrations and i believe audio too so if you need like any sort of like 
[03:59](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=239) royalty-free music or sound effects they have you covered there and it is cool because they also have illustrations that you can download for free that are free for public use and then we have 
[04:10](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=250) a little hidden gem that i think more people are finally starting to catch on to which is publicdomainvectors.org i've been using this for years and i know this site 
[04:20](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=260) looks a little corny but sometimes you can find some really good vectors in there if you're looking for something like a little bit cheesier 
[04:29](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=269) in a in a kind of like an ironic way if you want like something really clip already you can like find it there i found some really cool funny gems in there and so definitely a good one next 
[04:39](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=279) we have reshot.com which is vectors illustrations and photo fantastic site because it has those vectors and illustrations free for commercial use and then for a very specific one which i 
[04:51](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=291) wish i knew about more when i was younger and working in like an agency where we had really limited stock photo use is foodiesfeed.com and it is just food 
[05:01](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=301) photography um if you are a designer you know how hard it is to come up with really quality food photography sometimes if you don't have a budget to shoot something so this is a fantastic 
[05:12](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=312) site it's really great for like blogs too so that's foodiesfeed.com next we're going to be diving into mock-ups now i am a big believer in quality mockups they can 
[05:24](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=324) make or break an idea you're trying to convey to a client or really anyone viewing your work and sometimes you can make your own mock-ups if you have the time and the space to be able to like 
[05:34](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=334) shoot everything but especially when i was younger and in college and like starting out i did not have like the resources to do that and i relied really heavily on free mock-ups that were like 
[05:43](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=343) high quality um it didn't look like sometimes mock-ups can just look a little too much like mock-ups so i wanted to include sites for you guys that don't have too many super corny 
[05:54](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=354) mock-ups and ones that i actively use so it's really good to have like a big archive of these so you can just go and pull them whenever you need to just mock something up and you don't want to 
[06:03](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=363) re-download these files a bunch of times because sometimes they're like a gig and that's gonna take up a lot of space on your computer so by far my favorite mockup site is 
[06:14](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=374) mockupworld.com this is where i get the majority of my mockups i use in my videos and i think it consistently has like the highest quality easiest to use and they have like little packs so you 
[06:27](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=387) have like one view of something and then like you have three or four other files within that zip that you download so you have like different angles of something it could be like different signage could 
[06:37](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=397) be different overlays all sorts of good stuff and that kind of applies with like all of these mock-up sites but mockupworld.com is definitely my go-to before i found mockup world i 
[06:47](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=407) used graphicburger.com like it was the bible i used it like crazy especially when i was in college i think there are some limitations with the mock-ups that you can find on there 
[06:57](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=417) i think they're pretty common mock-ups because the site like took over the mock-up world like seven years ago so graphic burger is pretty good um just another one to have like in your archive 
[07:07](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=427) unblast.com is a new one that i found pretty recently they have a lot of like good assets all around but they do have a pretty good mock-up selection and the last one on our mock-up list i included 
[07:18](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=438) because i've used some mockups from there before um it's psdmockups.com i think this one's pretty good it does have some cornier mock-ups that look a little too mock-up and as 
[07:30](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=450) far as i remember off the top of my head all of these are completely free you can like pay money for some mock-ups i'm like if you really like one it'll go through enough clicks that'll bring you 
[07:41](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=461) to another site where you have to pay for it and that's completely up to your discretion if you have the budget to pay for something like that but um i would definitely say mock-up world is my 
[07:51](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=471) absolute favorite and they have just so so many on there but you know if i didn't include something in here leave it down in the comments or you know just click around do some googling all right 
[08:01](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=481) next we're moving on to the most exciting section which is fonts and if you follow my channel i get all of my fonts not all the majority the majority of my fonts through adobe fonz because 
[08:13](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=493) all of my stuff that i do like client-wise is all like major commercial work so i have to have a commercial license and i don't always have the budget to just go and buy another font 
[08:22](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=502) if i really like it if i do have the budget for it and they want a specific font we'll go buy it but just across the board because all of my work is commercial it's just easiest for me to 
[08:32](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=512) use adobe fonts and i'm already paying for it anyway so i might as well use the resource that's there but doesn't mean that there aren't other really cool sites that i use and pull from pull from 
[08:42](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=522) all the time and i think you guys should use them too so the top one on this list that is one of the most unique because it's one that i found pretty recently and i think the ux of it is pretty good 
[08:52](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=532) and i already mentioned it is unblast they have like i said a bunch of resources but they also have a pretty good font section the majority of the fonts are free for personal use only and 
[09:03](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=543) then you can also buy the commercial license but this is great if you are a student and just doing student work there's some really like unique fonts i think that you would see more in like 
[09:11](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=551) creative market that you have to pay for but these are free for personal use and there's just some really unique ones that i like don't see very often so definitely a cool resource that's 
[09:21](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=561) unblast.com fonts the next one is an obvious one but i forget about it quite frequently as someone who uses adobe fonts is google fonts back when i used to do web design 
[09:34](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=574) i like got it stuck in my brain that google fonts was only for web design it because i would only code it into sites and i forgot that like you can download the fonts from google fonts so 
[09:46](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=586) really good place for all of like your classic fonts it's very similar like ux wise to adobe fonts a lot of really great classic ones so it's just good to have in your archive because they're 
[09:56](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=596) free anyway don't forget about google phones now this was another one that i stumbled upon in my research to make sure like i had enough for each one of these categories but a site that i used 
[10:07](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=607) to frequent a lot when i was doing web design was awards or awards dot com which is a primarily a web design site but they also have other design related stuff and they have a section of free 
[10:20](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=620) fonts right now i don't know how long it's been up or how long it will be there but they have a really really cool group of fonts up there right now um all of this will be linked below by the way 
[10:31](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=631) but really really cool stuff it's mixed like personal and commercial use but definitely worth checking out there's some really like unique type faces in there 
[10:41](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=641) okay now these next two are really awesome because they are doing what i love to see in design and 
[10:49](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=649) that is open source type so the first one is open foundry and open foundry is a completely free platform that has a huge archive of just like beautiful fonts and they're all completely free 
[11:04](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=664) because they're an open source type foundry the next open source foundry we have is velveteen type if you've seen my favorite fonts video i mentioned frank at a ba he is an incredible type 
[11:15](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=675) designer and he has been working on velveteen velveteen type for quite a while and has some really beautiful open source typefaces that you can download for free 
[11:26](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=686) for commercial use personal use whatever now this last one isn't completely free but they do have a pay what you can option which i think is really cool and that is losttype.com they are just a 
[11:40](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=700) group of type designers who primarily specialize in like older more retro style type faces it's like very similar to like a lot of the typefaces that the hutzba sisters design really awesome 
[11:51](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=711) i've downloaded a few fonts from them before and it's just a really really cool collection of designers all the money that you pay to them go directly to the designer so they can keep making 
[11:59](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=719) these really unique typefaces now this next section is also one of my favorites i mean all of these are really my favorite sections but this next section is textures i am a huge believer in 
[12:11](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=731) textures and design they are so important and the number one tip the best resource i can recommend to anyone is to make your own textures there are a lot of like semi-okay sites out there 
[12:26](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=746) you can use sites like unsplash and download like concrete textures if like that's what you're looking for but in my humble opinion one of the best things 
[12:35](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=755) that you can do is find a scanner whether it's at school at your work an old printer from your parents uh get a printer from goodwill whatever it may be like if you can get your hands on even a 
[12:47](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=767) cheap scanner like the payback is tenfold i have a scanner that we originally got for scanning film strips and it's what i scan everything on i'm scanning paper textures i'm scanning 
[12:58](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=778) like little pieces of thread i'm scanning flowers i'm scanning t-shirt textures like just if you can like think of it just scan it and keep it in your archive because you can just drag and 
[13:08](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=788) drop it straight into your files manipulate it however you see fit for your work and then it's just yours you know what you're scanning you know all of like the assets that you have it is 
[13:19](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=799) in my opinion the best way to get a really good texture library going just start scanning everything if you can't scan start taking pictures of everything either with your phone or if 
[13:30](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=810) you have a camera or something just take pictures of it drag and drop into your programs and then manipulate it from there just from like a picture i do it all the time with flowers sometimes i 
[13:40](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=820) can't scan flowers in the way that i want to but sometimes it's easier for me to just snap a picture with my phone and then use that or if i need like a more interesting texture of like a piece of 
[13:52](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=832) fabric or like a t-shirt like i need like a really nice fold with some volume in it i'll just take a picture with my phone and then use that so all of that if you can think of it you can scan it 
[14:01](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=841) or take a picture of it for your own textures now if you do not want to do that which i totally get because it's a lot of work my favorite texture site and there aren't too many out there 
[14:11](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=851) is texture fabric i've mentioned them a few times in some past videos i do think they have a pretty good library of some like scanned textures some like kind of like speckly 
[14:22](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=862) spray textures some photocopy textures so they have a pretty good archive if you have other suggestions for textures let me know down in the comments because that i feel like is my 
[14:32](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=872) weakest category in regards to resources but i also make pretty much like 95 of the textures that i have so now time for the last section of this video and these are the best alternates to the adobe 
[14:47](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=887) programs i will disclose off the bat i currently use adobe and that is only because it's what i've been using for more than 10 years and it's burned into my brain and 
[15:01](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=901) that that's really it that's the only reason why i use adobe because i am really hesitant to learn new programs it's not something i enjoy so i do use adobe but i know a lot of people don't 
[15:11](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=911) use adobe and that includes some pretty major like industry designers i know who have never touched an adobe program in their life and they want to keep it that way and so i've talked to a lot of 
[15:21](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=921) people about the other programs that they use as well as like new people who have like picked up some like interesting and unique programs along the way and so i think that this is 
[15:31](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=931) roughly some of like somewhat top-tier programs as adobe alternates that's a really long-winded way to say here are the the best dupes for adobe um and not all of these are 
[15:43](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=943) 100 free but i do think that they are far more affordable than the highway robbery that is the adobe subscription if you 
[15:54](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=954) have the full adobe suite you are paying a 52.99 a month for two seats so that's a lot of money and you can get pretty much all of these other programs for less than a hundred 
[16:07](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=967) dollars and then you have them for life you never have to pay for them again adobe anyway um so the in no particular order one of the top programs that i have 
[16:20](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=980) found for a photoshop dupe is critta credit is a free program it is i believe raster based like photoshop and it is completely free and it is on windows mac and linux linux next we have 
[16:37](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=997) is free but it is for windows only then we have paint.net which is also for windows or pc only i know one phenomenal designer who's been a long time mutual of mine has used paint.net for all of 
[16:52](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1012) their projects and it blows my mind because i would have had no idea that they make these in paint.net so wow and then another one that i found in my research that i have not used but i have 
[17:04](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1024) seen it mentioned online is photo p and it's a browser based type of program i would really like to use it i want to i want to try using it because it sounds really interesting and so you 
[17:15](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1035) don't need a specific computer to be able to run this program because it all runs off of your browser next for our illustrator dupes the top one that i hear quite often is 
[17:26](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1046) inkscape it's free for mac and windows but i have heard that inkscape does run a little bit slower on mac and i do believe they're trying to fix that as i'm filming this next we have affinity 
[17:39](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1059) and affinity is one of those like cool programs that's like a mix of photoshop and illustrator it can work in raster and vector which i think is really cool 
[17:49](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1069) um it's 55 for the whole program it's on windows and mac and you have it for life and i know there's a cheaper version for the ipad 
[17:59](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1079) that i think is like 25 and then you also have that for life get free updates and everything wow affinity you did it right could be open source affinity not get away completely free 
[18:10](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1090) but better than and then the last one that i've seen people use for regular like vector-based design but also for ux and ui design and that is figma i feel like the ux for 
[18:21](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1101) figma is pretty similar to sketch which is a ux design based program but i've seen people make some pretty cool stuff in figma so those are the two big categories if you have any other 
[18:31](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1111) substitutions for photoshop or illustrator or a raster program versus a vector-based program let me know down in the comments next we're going to be moving on to the drawing category is how 
[18:40](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1120) i like i don't know that's how i'm describing it um the fan favorite for the drawing category for tablets like a regular tablet or an ipad is procreate i 
[18:52](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1132) am learning procreate right now and i swear to god i'm fighting for my life and procreate sometimes because i'm so bad at learning new programs procreate is 9.99 you have it for life and people 
[19:02](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1142) do some pretty like insanely beautiful work in procreate it sounds like such a robust program and i'm really excited to start using it more because i'm currently using adobe fresco and adobe 
[19:14](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1154) fresco is an incredibly frustrating program it's super limiting so i'm looking forward to learning procreate so 999 9.99 for life fantastic 
[19:24](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1164) um next we have charcoal which i feel like is more like a regular sketchbook type of sketching app that's completely free and then we have this really interesting one 
[19:34](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1174) that i found and that's paper by it seems like a really interesting program and i'm surprised that it came from wii transfer it's laid out kind of like a sketchbook which i think is i 
[19:46](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1186) don't know it's kind of fun it's kind of fun i do i do like some new approaches to drawing abs so i don't know that one's pretty cool it's free next we have our indesign dupes or our 
[19:57](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1197) layout programs as alternates to indesign the top one i think in this is canva canva is free but it also has paid versions you can do a lot in canva i would consider it more of a layout 
[20:09](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1209) program but you know you could do a lot of other things you could do like photo editing and stuff you can do like some not like vector based stuff but like some functions of illustrator then we 
[20:18](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1218) have affinity publisher which is 49 it is pretty much like a pretty solid alternate to indesign i've heard some really good things about affinity publisher it looks beautiful and the 
[20:33](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1233) same thing with with a regular affinity program um forty nine dollars you have it for life or it might be maybe fifty five dollars i don't 
[20:41](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1241) remember fifty to fifty five dollars somewhere in that range for affinity publisher and you have it for life and the last one i'm throwing in here for 3d because a 
[20:51](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1251) lot of 3d programs can get pretty insanely expensive i personally do not know any 3d programs but i have a lot of friends who do 3d and every single one of them started in blender if you don't 
[21:02](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1262) know blender is an open source 3d design program i think the ux of it is a little complicated i do think there's a pretty steep learning curve to blender but it is completely free and you can do some 
[21:14](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1274) insane work in there and 3d designers are in like huge demand right now so just throw that out there if you want to learn blender make that little donut i don't know i do think that that is the 
[21:24](https://youtu.be/myYwUoXfxt4?si=zyLdlisVN1PcgWUQ&t=1284) best 3d program i am slowly learning it i open it i get frustrated in that program and then i close it but i'll learn it eventually like procreate

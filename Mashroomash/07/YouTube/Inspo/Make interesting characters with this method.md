(Description:: The character gauntlet is a character making method, where I make 8 characters starting with traits and description, add them to a bracket, and each round I expand the story and visuals until 1 character wins. 3D modeling is done in Blender.)
Why did I do this? Mostly as writing practice.

# Transcript
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=0) I like making characters but they never really feel like they're real people which is a problem for anyone who wants to tell a story and I really want to get better at storytelling and make some 
[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=9) animated shorts eventually and that means I need to practice so I was thinking maybe I can start with a list of motivations and character traits and let that inform how I think the 
[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=19) character should look and if that goes well I can figure out a story that would make sense for them but my time is precious so I thought up the character gauntlet 
[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=31) what I'll do is think up eight characters and put them in this bracket to narrow them down until a winner emerges I'm talking about all the way to the top yeah but like I said my time is 
[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=41) precious so the first eight characters are only getting character sketches in basic descriptions and every new round we'll get more time dedicated to it more time developing the story and the visual 
[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=51) design and the characters that lose get thrown in the graveyard they aren't worth my time anymore I'm not working on them the Queen rise to the top yeah to decide who moves on to the next round 
[01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=61) I'll ask my viewers my friends and some other YouTubers who they like the most and to choose the winner I'll pitch the final two to a professional story consultant and he'll tell me if my ideas 
[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=71) are absolute garbage or not so first I have to gather some resources on writing and character design and I'll put links to everything down below there was this video by standard story company about a 
[01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=82) character first writing exercise that helped me a lot and then there is Lucas from local script man who has a bunch of great videos about script writing but specifically I'm looking at this recent 
[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=92) one about a character sheet he made and this other one about the anagram which is a personality typing system that works well as a writing tool I tried to boil down a lot of the anagram info into 
[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=103) this table that is easy to reference and it's mostly centered around different motivations fears desires and how people with those motivations might act so my process went something like this I 
[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=115) started thinking up random character traits like maybe this person is Undead innocent has an upset stomach and likes to give people gifts then I check the anyr table and figure out how these 
[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=127) traits could maybe relate to a motivation and there's this type who wants to be loved and afraid of being unwanted so maybe that works and it can help me expand the character maybe they 
[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=138) bend over backwards for people to the point of neglecting their own needs and I think of Undead as being a zombie that doesn't have a lot of energy so maybe they're tired all the time upset stomach 
[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=149) and being worried that people don't like them maybe that means they're anxious so you can see how I basically start with some random ideas and then try to tie them all together somehow and maybe I'll 
[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=159) throw in something else just to see if it can lead anywhere so I pretty much did this until I had eight characters just listing traits mixing and matching them until they fit together and I also 
[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=169) made note of how they could look visually based on these traits you know like if they're confident would they present themselves differently or maybe they have an accessory that relates to 
[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=179) their story like a key or a bracelet for this first round of the character Gauntlet I planned on giving every character a basic visual design so I put together this mood board to help inspire 
[03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=189) me checked the descriptions I made and started sketching but remember what I said about my time being precious well I saved some time by commissioning some concept art from artist animator Matt 
[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=200) Bixler AKA quillman I literally just gave him my notes and let him run with it and now that these characters are put together it's time for round one and to help narrow down these eight characters 
[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=211) to four I asked my viewers during a live stream what's up everybody all right first we have Cam versus Katie this is the concept art by quillman he's genetically engineered so maybe that's 
[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=223) why he's a bird as a result he's very fast and strong and naturally athletic but I want him to also be lazy and entitled because he grew up with Rich parents and has a luxurious life for 
[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=234) motivations he needs to think he's important and fears having no personality so maybe he compensates by wearing fancy clothes and accessories to impress people and gain status Katie is 
[04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=246) a magic user who is just getting started with magic and she has this big cursed bracelet that won't come off like maybe she's paranoid because of how she got the bracelet she doesn't trust people 
[04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=256) she's very observant and always looking for clues that could lead to her getting her bracelet off she could also study and read a lot and maybe this is how she starts learning about magic she needs to 
[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=267) feel competent and fears being incapable of solving her own problems this is Quan's interpretation where she looks tired and anxious and has these pants with lots of pockets for things she's 
[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=277) always carrying around my sketch is similar but instead of big pants I gave her a big coat thinking that she would need something with big sleeves to fit over the bracelet you just think the 
[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=287) bird a lot of people just like bird so people voting for cam are mostly just doing it for the looks you even like him even though he has sweat stains and smells funny okay if Katie was a bird 
[04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=296) would you all vote for Katie instead cam moves on we got 46 votes for cam people want birds all right next we have Rees and Rama so Reese's special thing is that he can hypnotize people and doesn't 
[05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=308) need to sleep he's a musician that is good at playing anything with keys I was thinking like piano and accordion maybe he practices obsessively and wants to be the best but never really is and he 
[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=320) thinks maybe this is because he's missing a finger I want him to be charismatic really social and likes to party maybe he pranks people to knock them down a Peg and assert his dominance 
[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=330) and he'll gatekeep information to ensure that he is always better in some way I also thought it could be funny to maybe make him immune to poison like in a restuant type way where he'll get 
[05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=340) knocked out but he never is really truly hurt Rama can fly but it's more like swimming in the air slow and awkward like an astronaut floating in space she likes plants wears socks without shoes 
[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=353) she gets fixated on hobbies to the point of neglecting other aspects of her life and she's addicted to reading internet forum she's very secretive and fantasizes about preparing for disasters 
[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=364) who should win someone wants them to be lizards okay okay if Reese wins then it would be cam vers Rees and then we'd have like two narcissists basically but people seem to like Rama more I'm 
[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=376) thinking that maybe Rama wins next is Chester and Sola Chester is Undead and he needs to feel loved and feel helpful and he fears being unworthy I want him to be very innocent and honest with 
[06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=389) people I like the idea of him being gullible like he wants people to like him so much that he'll trust whatever they say he's also stubborn and he'll overexert himself to make people happy 
[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=399) this causes him to be really tired all the time even though he's an undead person with a rash he somehow is good at gaining people's trust eventually I want him to have kind of like a Labrador 
[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=409) Retriever energy then we have Sola Sola is a beast person so she has some facial hair and grooms excessively they have a strong moral code and following that code is her idea of what it means to be 
[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=421) good so having Integrity is important and she fears being corrupted they're very habit oriented has rituals and is organized maybe she's a big picture thinker so she has big goals and 
[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=432) everything else is Trivial to her we got Chester have solo so far solo is winning but it's pretty close still so we got Undead verse like a beast person let's end the poll we'll say solo wins and 
[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=444) finally we have Willow and BT Willow has freakishly fast reaction speed and and I also gave her a pet rat she's very courageous and will put herself in danger to protect people and animals 
[07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=455) she's a natural leader she's very confident sometimes so much that it bothers other people around her she's motivated by her need to be in control of her environment and fears being 
[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=466) controlled by others she isn't a very good Problem Solver and mostly runs on intuition and she's got a bunch of tattoos and this Crystal Ball BT is a robot that used to do some sort of 
[07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=476) security but doesn't anymore maybe because of of some sort of damage now they're driven by the want to have new experiences and fear being deprived or missing out they daydream about all the 
[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=487) things they're going to do very optimistic and they don't like being alone maybe they get impatient with people who don't want to go out and do things but I want them to be a pacifist 
[08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=497) that doesn't really get confrontational quman gave them these hands that are like multi-tools and this little vest which I like literally at 50/50 right now yeah she could be a bird but you 
[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=509) know bird with a rat what if the B and BT stands for bird all right let's end the poll Willow wins so these are the final four these other ones move them to the graveyard so sad all right so these 
[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=521) are the final four and now I have to start modeling them expand their stories and start round two of the character Gauntlet uh someone in the chat is asking about this website I'm using to 
[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=531) organize everything funny you should ask I'm using Milano to put all this together and they're sponsoring this video milino is a tool for organizing creative projects and it's especially 
[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=542) good for visual thinkers this is the main board for this video which was easy to start because I just used this brainstorming template but maybe you're interested in some other topic like 
[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=553) writing film making or interior design well they have over 100 templates to choose from to help you get started I used this character design template for each character and also this mood board 
[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=566) one and I really like how you can expand an any direction to suit your needs sometimes I work better when everything I need is right in front of me it works really well in addition to other tools 
[09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=577) like for this mood board I already had some references saved on Pinterest and Instagram and it literally let me just drag and drop everything so I can just go to Pinterest over here I'm just 
[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=587) dragging it dropping it straight into Milano and there it is but if that ever doesn't work they also have a web clipping tool that lets you save images and links from any website directly to 
[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=598) milanote I Ed some other note- taking apps already and it's really impressive how easy it is to bring stuff into Millan note like I already have some storytelling notes on notion one of 
[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=608) which is this table with info on different anagram types so in Millan note over here I can create a table and I'll just go over here and copy the table and then come over here and paste 
[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=621) it and you can see that it kept the correct formatting in everything and this isn't something that works in a lot of apps so I was really surprised by how well it works if you want to share your 
[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=633) work you can invite people to comment and collaborate in real time and the feedback of seeing what other people are looking at and what they're doing makes the experience much more enjoyable in my 
[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=643) opinion mileno is available for free with no time limit so you've got nothing to lose by trying it start your next creative project using milanote just use my link in the description and if you 
[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=654) like it let me know in the comments thank you Milano for sponsoring this video so for round two I made a simple model for each character and tried to come up with a backstory using this 
[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=664) character sheet which was made by Lucas from the local script man channel by the way the next video will be about modeling characters for beginners so subscribe if you don't want to miss that 
[11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=675) and to get the winners of this round I'll be talking to a list of people to see what they think sorry I'm sorry if you hear my cat funny no it's fine uh we have Cam and we have Rama he has parents 
[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=686) who are scientists created him to become kind of like a diplomat type and they have these plans for him but he wants to be his own person and pursue his own thing we built you with an intention and 
[11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=696) it's weird that you're not moving toward Our intention for you so they treat him like an experiment instead of treating him like a son and as a result of this he believes that if he has a lot of 
[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=705) interests and opinions that people will notice and appreciate his value as a person how this actually like manifests is that he thinks he has Superior tastes and his opinions are worth more and 
[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=715) people should want to be in his company because he just has this value right he he ties his value as a human being to being smart and interesting and having cool things to say well he's kind of a 
[12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=725) conceited person uh status is very important to him so that informs a lot of how he acts he's the most perfect Bird that's ever been genetically made that's what he thinks then we have Rama 
[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=737) maybe she had an overbearing family when she was little they would do stuff for her and kind of not let her learn things on her own and she didn't really see this as a bad thing until she went to 
[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=746) school and she started getting made fun of by other kids poking fun it maybe she doesn't know how to do something like tie her shoes they're like you should know how to do that by now uh and this 
[12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=755) like really embarrassed her she's at school or something and then all of a sudden like she starts floating and then she's like ah what the hell and all the students are like you floating freak I 
[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=763) like that as a result of that she believes that she'll be safe from criticism as long as she is secretive and she learns how to be independent and is always learning new things and then 
[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=773) people won't be able to make fun of her it's competence as a as a coping mechanism she thinks she just doesn't need the company of other people to be happy and she's better off not meeting 
[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=782) new people cuz they aren't worth the effort and they're just going to hurt her feelings eventually maybe her powers are related to her emotions and stuff the ark could be involved in gaining 
[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=792) control of her flying or maybe even the opposite where she can rest on Solid Ground like it doesn't end with her flying it just ends with her being grounded a stutter or something would be 
[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=803) something relatable when she tries to start talking to people after a long break she's like talking as if she's in her in her monologue she just like is constantly looking at forums and uh 
[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=813) other people having conversations but never takes part becomes this kind of vois thing a little bit she wants to learn how to become completely self-sufficient in kind of like an 
[13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=822) off-grid like Homestead kind of way I was just going to say that yeah she's practicing she's trying to be ready for when she's out there on the farm but like she's not actually taking any steps 
[13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=830) to start doing that know how to order food and have them drop it off perfectly so you never have to interact with them she has one person who always wants to be around no matter how like nasty she 
[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=841) is they still like her and in her mind this is her enemy but it's just someone who wants to be friends she's so unused to like regular companionship that she can only interpret it as like stalking 
[14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=850) it's making me think of uh Keef from that episode of Invader Zim yeah yeah yeah get out of my house I told you you're fired you don't like waffles I think that could be an interesting way 
[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=860) of getting her to like open up somehow some people are worth the effort or something like that out of these two which one would you rather see in a story all the stuff we were just talking 
[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=869) about with Rama like there's there's so much there difficult decision because on one hand I think cam would be more comedic but Rama would be more relatable I think I'm going to go with Cam uh well 
[14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=882) well I mean how can cam fly no oh there you go so you think Rama I think Rama the realization that her ability to fly directly impacts her emotional state and vice versa is a really fun element to 
[14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=895) explore like I can imagine him being a secondary character who is relatively less deep I like Rama she's secretive right now but she could I know get more confident later cam cam the man the most 
[15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=908) recognizable characters are the ones that you can recognize in their silhouette and their color scheme this is like a tough decision design wise I feel both of these characters are very 
[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=917) strong I always gravitate more towards Critters animals and things like that just given my own art style having to choose one I would lean towards cam more strictly because he has a much more 
[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=930) interesting silhouette Rama has a little bit more like main character energy I think both of these characters would work best in sort of an ensemble cast a joey High School sitcom where kind of 
[15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=943) all these characters mingle and interact personally I'm leaning towards Rama more if you want to steal any of these ideas these are all my original characters now I'm posting them on Twitter then go 
[15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=952) ahead cuz I do feel like both of them have and the way that you've set up these character sheets is like they have these traits that kind of make room for a story to be told I was with Rama from 
[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=963) the beginning to be honest I think Cam's really fun but I feel like Rama I Just Vibe with so much more Rama such a great opportunity to show off their personality in a way which is really 
[16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=973) endearing whereas I feel like with Cam you can make somebody that you just hate the next two we have Sola and we have willow Sola is a beast person like chip monkey and Gremlin noid Critter yeah I 
[16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=986) like it her big thing is that she has like a strong set of morals that she follows maybe she had a dad who was a gambler who would often sell their things for money would leave her alone 
[16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=997) for periods of time and this caused her to become independent at a very young age as a response to this she believes that she must take care of herself and others and never inherit the bad traits 
[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1007) of her parents and other bad role models from her childhood and I'm imagining the father is also a little gramy Lloyd dwarf man okay cool she thinks that some people are too bad to ever change and 
[16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1018) that you have to people before they become corrupted and she wants to bring better Education and Care to every kid in the world very idealistic like not really attainable like solving world 
[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1028) hunger type thing where she's always aiming towards that because of her unstable upbringing she clings to her job afraid to quit because of fear of uh losing stability I thought maybe she 
[17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1039) works at like a convenience store or something but that could always change I almost picture her in like even a worse job like she works at like in a basement and she doesn't get to see anyone just 
[17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1048) like so weird boss that she has or something a weird guy yeah know I I like that and this kind of solidifies some of her views about bad people I could totally see bringing in a character 
[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1059) that's like the opposite of her comes into the same workplace and is like not organized her meeting someone that like shows her like oh like you have to take rest sometimes and it's like healthy and 
[17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1070) good way more daring and uh spontaneous and gets them to quit or something within the first week and it's like opening her mind that things are possible you can just leave you can just 
[17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1079) walk out you know the key it could be some sort of story element maybe she finds it at work eventually it moves the story forward when she finds out what it's actually for then we have willow he 
[18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1089) has very fast reaction speed the kind of backstory that I have for her a lot of it comes down to struggle with like being in control I thought maybe her parents made her be a child actor and 
[18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1099) she was in like commercials or something like that and she really hated it she didn't have control over her own life she thinks that things will go well as long as she stays in control of her 
[18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1110) environment she thinks that she should be in charge because she is a good leader and everybody already trusts her judgment yeah her heart's in the right place regardless of how she tackles the 
[18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1119) problem I like the idea of things like always kind of working out for her even if uh she like makes the wrong decision and this is kind of always uh boosting her ego she thinks she's doing a great 
[18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1130) job but maybe everyone in the group is like okay well and she can't like read the situation right she thinks she's totally in control but everyone is like doing the logical thing and then she 
[18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1139) sees the end result where everything works out and she's like that was me nobody's following her advice at all and it's just her perception of the world is completely skewed her very fast reaction 
[19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1148) speed has something to do with the power of the crystals she's interested in whether or not it actually is responsible I think it could be funny uh either way you can make it completely 
[19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1158) from her point of view where it is just magical she thinks it's magical so it is magical just like how all the other things that she just kind of makes up Andor thinks of ways to solve problems 
[19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1167) that are kind of silly and probably bad end up actually working she was right the crystals are real between these two characters like which one would you rather see a story about 
[19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1176) umm are they in the same universe or is it not necessarily it's going to be tough decision that's actually really difficult to say do you inage all of these characters existing in the same 
[19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1186) universe I'm actually super interested in how this just diverse cast of characters would interact with each other with the radically different personalities but I I know that's not 
[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1196) the game we're playing here so play playing the game I think I'm going to have to go a solo but again I'd honestly like to see all four of these characters pitted on an adventure like I I really 
[20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1205) just want to see them all interact I would probably do Sola I think Sola you can do a lot with like body comedy always having a shaving in jury and being super small Willow is just a more 
[20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1217) fun character out of the both of them Willow I like the crystal ball and yeah the overall design of the character more my my vote is for Sola for sure yeah like I like the key I like theing Le 
[20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1228) tooth I like the hair covering the eyes I feel like it's clearer like having like a really strong goal like that I think for me Sola wins Sola she has more potential I think Solo solo we have all 
[20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1240) these like really practical story hook stuff Willow I think I'm just enjoying more in the like original character sense which one wins I feel like it's solo dwarf girl easily come on the world 
[20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1251) that you've built of the possibility that there's this like Beast person who has motivations of making a better future is like really interesting and can go anywhere it's really exciting but 
[21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1263) I did have to like force myself to keep listening to Willow's story and I was just staring at Solo in the corner of the screen now that Cam and Willow have been thrown into the graveyard I get to 
[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1272) expand Rama and Solo's story so I took all the ideas that people gave me and filled out this sheet to give them simple arcs now it's time to decide the winner and to do that I'll pitch these 
[21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1282) characters to a professional story consultant who you might recognize because I've already mentioned him a few times Lucas from the local script man channel is that my thing down there yeah 
[21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1292) it is I I I use those a little okay so Rama this is what she looks like right now I like the socks yeah thanks that's actually related to yeah I think all this makes a lot of 
[21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1306) sense clearly like a lot of thought gone into this I think it's not just she's afraid of being humiliated I think I would make it a little deeper she feels like she has to be capable and competent 
[21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1316) but it's not just a social thing it's just like she's fundamentally anxious about the world and she was punished for incompetence right and a lack of knowledge early in life so it sort of 
[22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1326) formed this complex of of um always needing to learn always needing to be prepared ready sort of like a doomsday prepper like for type fives The Stereotype is the intellectual nerd but 
[22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1336) it can just as easily become like physical competence sort of material competence right like hoarding wealth resources maybe she's out on one of her running away things she is humiliated in 
[22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1348) public again is kind of a thing that um explains her belief that people are just out to hurt her or whatever I don't think she runs away I think you need to give her a special hidey-hole like some 
[22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1358) flying Treehouse up in the sky it's it's got to be a safe place though what would cause her to like interact with somebody yeah you have to create some sort of Crisis where she feels the need to to 
[22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1369) leave her bubble like if she needs like there's a certain computer part or something and oh [¬†__¬†] I got to go to Best Buy now and get it and I have to deal with all these these random 
[22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1377) strangers freak me out fundamentally an arc for a person like this looks like learning to be okay with the uncertainty of the world for Sola she's a beast person yeah looks like um D the Explorer 
[23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1390) but like a gremlin her actions are in opposition to the role models that she had when she was a kid yeah that makes sense I think type one complex can come from two 
[23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1403) places it can either come from you were raised in like a Puritan environment there's a right way to act you got this way you're impure you're going to go to hell you know that's one of them and 
[23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1412) then the other one is you know like this where you basically grow up around people with no integrity and because of that well they develop a sort of superiority complex basically the world 
[23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1420) around me was was bad and it all fell apart and I'm better I have to rise above that but that's what the ark looks like it's like letting yourself do something against your code you know 
[23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1430) realizing that like your code isn't everything and sometimes you have to break the rules so get out of your like your bubble and actually go do the thing being afraid of like losing stability 
[23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1439) she has like a job she doesn't like and she doesn't really get to pursue the whole thing with like helping kids or whatever yeah that seems a bit in congruent someone like this stability 
[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1448) isn't really a factor that's the whole that's the whole point they'll actively throw away their stability they're not going to exist in a situation that they think is wrong I think if anything she's 
[24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1457) in a dysfunctional situation that she believes is right even though it's clearly not working maybe she it's a job she thinks is like really important yes yeah that that's what I'm saying it 
[24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1466) could still be a thing that she doesn't like but kind of fits her idea of like changing the world for the better she's at like some NGO and it like actually sucks I think it has to be actively like 
[24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1477) like not a functional organization or not a functional thing she has to get over the fact that hey maybe if I was willing to cut Corners I could actually make things better let yourself be 
[24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1487) corrupted let yourself go against the grain for once a new coworker or something that comes in and has like the bad qualities of her dad or something and this is the person that gets her to 
[24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1498) kind of change her ideas you know like showing her the truth yeah that's what she needs I think this whole stability risk thing that's more something that like Rama would be concerned with so she 
[25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1507) would like find out the truth about her job maybe leave to pursue something else or something like that to create an actual plot you just need more stuff in your sandbox like it can't just be this 
[25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1516) character well yeah she thinks she has the key to everything and then maybe other people have keys too and she's like wait you have a key I thought that I was the one with the key to everything 
[25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1524) she thinks the key is going to take her to heaven but it really takes her to like the land of corner cutting and solutionism give that character a hard left turn exactly when you need it you 
[25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1533) know yeah between these two characters and their stories which one think has more potential well I mean they're just characters why couldn't they both be in the same story they totally 
[25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1544) could um right now solo story it's very easy to give a character like that like a a very clear goal you know whereas type fives tend to not have a clear goal they tend to be like the goal is just to 
[25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1556) maintain equilibrium Ian towards making this a solo story all right that's it solo wins all the other characters get thrown into the graveyard never to be seen again I am the queen you know that 
[26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1567) I'm the queen of the crap wait wait a minute are they in the same universe or is it you inage all of these characters existing in the same universe i' honestly like to see all four of these 
[26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1577) characters pitted on an adventure wait wait a minute wait a minute this was a fun way of making a bunch of characters but when it comes to writing stories I could make them interact instead of 
[26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1586) throwing away the losers and it's seems like other people are thinking this too I lean towards making this a solo story but I think you you need other characters um oh absolutely yeah yeah 
[26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1596) okay so Rama is a very um secluded capable person so maybe Solan needs to seek her out it's like oh yeah she's the best um Tech person uh in in the whole of the world we need your help to get 
[26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1607) this thing to get this key in this chest open and then you know Rama is along for the journey now too you have to put them into Conflict by introducing a situation that the type of thing that Rama would 
[26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1616) fully disagree with would be like they're on like a little Lord of the Rings Quest Rama going off the path to go save somebody and so will be like we have to do that and R's like are you 
[27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1624) kidding me like it's probably a trap it's probably know yeah that's the type of thing they would fight over good yeah I mean if Willow was in your your Rama story solo whatever the Grim one then 
[27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1633) Willow would be someone who is willing to cut those corners and willing to get her hands dirty and you know cam could fit into it too as a character who's basically only in this for like oh I get 
[27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1643) to save the world who okay that's that seems like a that'll look good on my resume you know ultimately his payoff is he does something that no one will ever know about or maybe even he compromises 
[27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1652) his reputation to do the right thing like I said I'm kind of more of like a visual artist but I definitely plan on doing more writing and stuff in the future yeah yeah I don't I don't think 
[27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1661) of visuals like at all yeah people think very differently about it which is cool different starting points I really appreciate this yeah yeah no I love doing this this is what I'm all about I 
[27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1670) definitely learned a lot while making this video starting characters with traits and motivations made them feel more real and distinct and it can be really useful for when I'm not feeling 
[27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1679) creatively motivated because it almost makes the process feel more like problem solving as for storytelling practice I think next time I'd like to start with some thematic elements or concepts 
[28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHOiC23HBw&t=1690) instead of a character first approach and writing some dialogue could be fun too big news big big news Southern shotti's short film watermelon girl is finally done and you must watch it right

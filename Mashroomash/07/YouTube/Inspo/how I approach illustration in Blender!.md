(Description:: this isn't a tutorial, but just a kinda overview of how i use Blender in my work! might not be super useful for actual practical stuff, but i hope it maybe inspires you to try it yourself!)
# Transcript
[00:00](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=0) [Music] hey everyone I thought I might talk a little bit about how I approach illustration and blender note that this is not a tutorial per se I don't plan on 
[00:16](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=16) walking you through every possible step to make one specific illustration but rather I'd like to highlight some general ideas and tools that you might find useful in using blender for your 
[00:25](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=25) own art nor is this necessarily a beginner's guide to blender although I hope to show the relatively straightforward path I typically follow from beginning to end for pieces such as 
[00:36](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=36) [Music] these there are infinitely many things I don't know about blender and also infinitely many ways of creating art with it maybe this video will get you 
[00:55](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=55) started on that Journey let's go chapter one reference and inspiration first of all I'd like to highlight my own influences in 3D because I believe that will give some 
[01:06](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=66) context to my Approach view Masters ' 80s and 90s editorial and picture book illustration encompassing the Aesthetics of utopian Scholastic fras Urbane Memphis and many more video games 
[01:18](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=78) encompassing in-game models ads promotional art these all factor into my current style what these examples all share is a sense of wonder strong compositions shape language color and 
[01:29](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=89) Lighting and a sense of texture and tactility the principles of 2D Mark making apply just as strongly with 3D which I feel it's often overlooked but with 3D you have additional elements of 
[01:41](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=101) easily manipulated textures lights edges and so I love to really lean into the 3D of it all I come from a 2d background so I strongly believe in using blender in ways that would be simply impossible or 
[01:54](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=114) at least very difficult to emulate in a normal painting program such as Photoshop or procreate chapter 2 
[02:04](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=124) modeling I recorded myself making this simple piece my foolish cats being little tyrants to a poor down Trot and Cricket as an example of my process I'm going to first introduce the 
[02:15](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=135) tools that I use then show them in practice usually I take a variety of planes and cubes and sculpt them to my needs so I in fact do not delete the default 
[02:26](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=146) Cube it's very important to be comfortable navigating in 3D space quickly so make sure you familiarize yourself with the proper orbit and zooming 
[02:35](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=155) controls I personally check emulate three button Mouse under preferences input which for me on Mac means that holding option is rotating holding option and control is 
[02:47](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=167) zooming and holding option and shift is panning but find what works best for you from here one can do a variety of things shift a brings up the menu for adding objects of which there are many 
[03:01](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=181) and hitting tab enters or exits edit mode from which you can do many things such as make Loop Cuts with command r or move various aspects of the mesh around as we'll see 
[03:11](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=191) shortly 1 2 and three toggle between vertices edges and faces and hitting G for grab lets you move these around hitting R for rotate and S for scale work 
[03:28](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=208) similarly importantly hitting X Y or Z let you move things on each of those axes up here you can see a menu that changes the orientation of those axes 
[03:41](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=221) for instance Global orientation which is the orientation of the entire scene or an object's local orientation or even the orientation of the view you are currently 
[03:50](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=230) observing additionally over here is the way to change where the pivot point of your transformation is this is Handy for when you want to change from resizing a bunch of objects as a unit to resizing 
[04:01](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=241) them individually among other things now there are a few basic things I can do to quickly model I can extrude using [Music] 
[04:12](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=252) e inset using [Music] I and bevel using B these will get you really quite far try it 
[04:28](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=268) out right that was a lot of information but it's really important to be familiar with these tools I could make some kind of a cat with just that and a few cubes 
[04:40](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=280) I suppose but now is the time that I start to use modifiers to help me model located under this wrench over here if I use a subdivision modifier it rounds out the edges of a mesh and makes 
[04:51](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=291) it easier for me to get something organic looking oh and uh simply right click and check shade smooth to do exactly that you can also select individual faces to make them smooth or 
[05:02](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=302) flat depending on your needs if I now extrude you can see how the mesh is pleasingly rounded off there are many other useful modifiers such as mirror array and 
[05:15](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=315) solidify these can stack all while keeping the original mesh but if you want to apply a modifier simply hit command a while hovering over it hopping over to my progress video you 
[05:28](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=328) can see that this is exactly what I do to rough out the shapes of my illustration I go through iterations of shapes placements camera locations aspect ratios All In Search of a 
[05:37](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=337) pleasing composition I am of the opinion that if your scene looks appealing with absolutely no textures or lighting it bodess well for the final picture and 
[05:46](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=346) the lighting and the texturing that's the fun part chapter three lighting and texturing the fun part oh yes this is what I live for 
[05:56](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=356) placing lights adding bumpy fun textures picking colors and generally trying to make something look crunchy and grainy kind of old school you can use either the e or 
[06:07](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=367) Cycles Render engines located here you'll get great results either way but these days I tend to prefer Cycles because of how it handles water and volumetric effects as well as its noisy 
[06:18](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=378) look when you don't let it render all the way Eevee is much faster though don't forget to turn on ambient occlusion and Screen space Reflections for best 
[06:28](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=388) results now H Let's uh go up to the shading Tab and check this sphere to get your rendered view mess around with things a bit the roughness the color the 
[06:41](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=401) metallic add some lights with shift a grab them move them around this part never gets old now I don't really want to get into the nitty-gritty about nodes which are 
[06:55](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=415) these little guys right here but I would highly suggest learning some Basics about how these Bad Boys work I was resistant myself at first but they are absolutely key to making 
[07:05](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=425) materials work for you for something fun try using shift a and add a wave texture and a color ramp connect those up and see the weird results you can 
[07:18](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=438) [Music] get or Instead try a gradient texture and a color ramp for an ombre effect you can get pretty far with just that but it's really fun to mess with 
[07:31](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=451) pre-made materials and for that I would suggest blender kit which is an add-on that contains a huge library of stuff to use by judiciously applying these and tweaking them many basic scenarios are 
[07:43](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=463) going to be covered from wood to metal glass water fabric alien flesh oranges eyeballs goo slime at this point UV unwrapping 
[08:00](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=480) becomes important this is basically the unwrapping and flattening of all the faces on a 3D object into a flat plane so that an image can be used as its material sometimes the scale or mapping 
[08:11](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=491) of the materials you apply will simply be wrong sometimes comically so you could teach a whole course on this alone and I certainly don't know best practices for it but there's quick ways 
[08:21](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=501) to get the job done if something looks too small or large hit tab to enter edit mode and go up to the UV menu us usually using smart UV project combined with resizing or moving the resulting map 
[08:34](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=514) down here will get you close enough using project from view is really handy when I have a specific painted texture that I make it does exactly what it says so if you paint a texture in 
[08:44](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=524) Photoshop appr procreate from a certain angle you can just overlay it like that flipping back to my progress video you can see I go through a lot of iterations in trying things I try 
[08:55](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=535) different materials I move lights around and I screen cap the C hats and paint directly on top of them in Photoshop then bring that texture back in using project from view by the way all the 
[09:06](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=546) shortcuts for grabbing and rotating and scaling things stay the same here so don't forget them I add a couple of more objects including a small painting of the cats 
[09:16](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=556) for this picture frame and that's really about it for my basic process as you can see I keep things very simple and I keep things designed for one angle only there's something really graphic that I 
[09:27](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=567) like about this approach and it means that it not only takes less time but it forces me to think about composition and light in a constrained way which somehow actually makes it easier to make choices 
[09:38](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=578) and that's always a good thing total time for this around an hour and 15 minutes and a lot of that was occupied fixing random geometry mistakes I made in the beginning still not great at that 
[09:48](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=588) part folks chapter 4 final touches after rendering I often do touch-ups and enhancements of color in Photoshop a trick that I learned from 
[09:59](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=599) from the great cats an incredible painter who I worked with on we lost our human over at Netflix is to use color lookup which Maps colors from your image onto a predesigned different palette 
[10:09](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=609) often imitating color palettes of old film stocks this adds a saturation and contrast that makes your renders look more photo to me try different 
[10:19](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=619) combos I add a cutesy border using the polygonal lasso tool and Bob your uncle for past art I've often used other techniques to crus toy render for something like a view Master you can 
[10:31](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=631) duplicate your layer turn off different color channels and nudge them around to emulate chromatic aberration for something like an old video game magazine illustration you can 
[10:43](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=643) duplicate your layer use the color half tone filter and find a good blending mode to emulate the printing process it all depends on the type of feeling you're going for which makes it 
[10:54](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=654) all the more important to have a good library of references chapter 5 closing thoughts there's approximately 10 quadrillion things you can click on in 
[11:05](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=665) blender and that doesn't even include the additional gazillion add-ons that improve enhance and add crazy features I didn't even touch on sculpting which is a really fun part of 
[11:16](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=676) 3D regardless I hope I've shown you some interesting things and I hope that your blender journey is filled with joyous satisfying moments of creating it has both really changed how 
[11:26](https://youtu.be/Nvk8V_yfR9c?si=K1YmWHKdXLVo-Lon&t=686) I approach art and also been a wonderful for utilizing the design principles I already know in 2D in a new way it feels good to be able to channel the magical realism the stylized but

[00:00](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=0) working in 3D gives you an insane amount of flexibility creativity and if you can get these three things right you'll be an expert at blender you're going to get great living and be able to do what you 
[00:10](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=10) want when you want so in this video I'm going to take my eight plus years of 3D experience and condense that down into a three-part framework that I would follow if I was starting completely from 
[00:21](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=21) scratch in blender today this is the blueprint starting off right if you have no experience with 3D and having a concise game plan like this would have saved me loads of time at the beginning 
[00:33](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=33) so let's cover these one at a time oh foreign level one get started if your starting blender completely from scratch it can 
[00:44](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=44) be like grinding the Max Cape in old school RuneScape it's incredibly difficult extremely time consuming and it's lonely this is where most people stop they open the program try moving 
[00:57](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=57) the default Cube around then go back to Doom scroll and Tick Tock it's the first major hurdle you'll come across when starting with blender and that is not knowing what the hell anything does so 
[01:10](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=70) at this stage I'd build out a structure a simple set of goals setting what I want to achieve my first four weeks of blender these goals should build on top of each other to one major goal for your 
[01:22](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=82) first month and these can be super simple the goal is to not overwhelm yourself at the beginning for me my major goal would be to create one render of a complete scene with textures and an 
[01:34](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=94) environment to get that major goal done this is where I'd set up these sub goals for example goal one learn blender's user interface and navigation gold to build out a simple scene with primitive 
[01:45](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=105) objects goal 3 learn the basics of modeling and lighting you get the idea the main takeaway here is to just get started because if you think about it learning blender and 3D in general is a 
[01:58](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=118) high value skill having this skill set under your belt opens up so many opportunities and potential career changes that can be life-changing but the first few weeks of learning a new 
[02:10](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=130) skill are almost always the make or break point for continuing learning or completely giving up trust me I know now if you're in the stage of level one 
[02:22](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=142) and you've just completed your first major goal first off congratulations second off we now want to repeat this process two more times having at least three projects under your belt will not 
[02:33](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=153) only solidify what you've learned during this time but it'll also encourage you and inform you if you truly do want to pursue 3D as a career trust me when I tell you you will want to give up 
[02:45](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=165) especially if you're starting from scratch since you probably have a full-time job maybe even a family to take care of there's not a lot of time to actually work on this let alone find 
[02:56](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=176) the resources to learn from which is why I suggest a curated learning path like a course or a class on skillshare you probably know skillshare for their courses in photography and cooking but 
[03:07](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=187) I'm guessing you didn't know they have loads of career focused classes as well and in the theme of today's video they conveniently have a curated selection of blender glasses I highly recommend 
[03:17](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=197) checking out Southern Jodi's array of classes and more specifically your first day in blender 3D this class will get you up to speed with blender in roughly 30 minutes and it's geared towards 
[03:28](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=208) beginners honestly with skillshare no goal is too small as there are plenty of skillshare teachers like this guy and hey even me skillshare teachers walk you step by step through the process I've 
[03:41](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=221) been using their platform for years and it truly is a fantastic way to jump start your learning even if it isn't blender related skillshare is sponsoring this video and they've given me an 
[03:52](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=232) amazing offer for you guys the first 1000 people to use the link below look at a one month free trial of skillshare using that link really does help support the channel that lets me do this whole 
[04:02](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=242) YouTube thing for free for you click that link and thank you so much to skillshare for sponsoring this video [Music] right so you now have three projects 
[04:15](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=255) under your belt and a basic understanding of 3D and this is where you have a decision to make do you want to be in a casual relationship with blender or do you want to be in a 
[04:23](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=263) serious relationship with blender bringing it back to that RuneScape analogy you might be like all right I only want to farm cast in lumbridge this is the level I'm happy with and I just 
[04:33](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=273) want to hear the cow depth sound effect if that's you I totally get it but if you're a serious gamer you want to reach that Max Cape and this is where we move to level two get good this is the stage 
[04:46](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=286) where I would actively and consciously decide I want to get serious about learning blender and I'm going to make one project per week because to me that's take kids seriously you can't 
[04:56](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=296) build out the necessary skills to create a name for yourself or build a career in 3D if you don't have the body of work to show for it so from here on out I'd be making one project per week for at least 
[05:07](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=307) three months that's going to bump your total predicts from three all the way to 15 and with level 2 its focus is get good but I put it to brackets enough because the point of making all these 
[05:20](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=320) projects is to get good at the craft of 3D there's so many skills that go into becoming an effective 3D artist there's lighting modeling animation rigging texturing compositing rendering the list 
[05:33](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=333) of skills to learn is crazy love and again this model we're starting from scratch I don't know how to do any of this yet so during this time I'd be focusing on actively trying to improve 
[05:44](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=344) my projects and the general craft of 3D the first week could be solely about nailing the ladding on the default Cube second week could be creating a procedural texture and understanding the 
[05:55](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=355) texture workflow these aren't major projects and they certainly won't be going on our portfolio but they're still holding the crafts and getting one percent better with each project and by 
[06:06](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=366) the way you don't need to worry about your career skill set or your Niche yet these are just projects to get you in the game get good at the craft of 3D and ultimately find what you enjoy most 
[06:17](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=377) again back to that RuneScape analogy this is like trying different skill grinds maybe you really love Fletching that absolutely hate Hunter and across these 15 projects not only are you 
[06:29](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=389) getting good at the craft of 3D and blender but you're also learning about yourself and what you enjoy doing most let me value and show me plays a massive role in this whole framework and once 
[06:40](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=400) you've passed level two you need to ask yourself the ultimate question and that is [Music] foreign 
[06:50](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=410) are you a hobbyist or are you a business if you've made it past level two you should be able to answer that pretty quickly the simplest way to answer it is just throw it on the scale from 1 to 10. 
[07:00](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=420) if you're leading towards the hobby side that's totally fine but if you do want to push this further into a business and this is where we move to level three which is get serious 
[07:12](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=432) so at this stage I have 15 projects under my belt they're all over the place but this is where I'd want to build out a very specific skill set that I know inside and out something I can slowly 
[07:23](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=443) Dominate and confidently say I am X or I am why this is my thing and I'm really good at it for example if this were me and I could go back in time product animation and product rendering would be 
[07:37](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=457) my Niche it pays ridiculously well I'm comfortable with it and there's loads of clients looking for this service so once you have your ideal niche in mind there are three steps to success Step One is 
[07:50](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=470) build and this is where I'd start building a high quality portfolio of Works remember the past 15 projects were just getting good at the craft of 3D now I'd want to put that to the test and 
[08:01](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=481) create three hyper Focus projects of my best quality work inside the niche that I've chosen these will be to Showcase my skill set and what I have to offer potential clients or employers which 
[08:13](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=493) brings us to step two Land once I have at least three projects that I'm happy with I'd start the process of lead gen I know this is getting kind of technical but stick with me it's not as difficult 
[08:25](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=505) as it sounds lead gen is just a simple term for outreach or connecting with potential customers so with that in mind I'd be called emailing and dming local businesses Brands heck even at agencies 
[08:38](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=518) the worst you can get is a no and trust me what I tell you you're going to get plenty of no's the key to step two is to not get discouraged and more importantly do this 
[08:50](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=530) at scale if you're dming three brands and saying smeef this isn't working I can pump those numbers up those are rookie numbers in this racket the good metric I use is to just assume a two 
[09:00](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=540) percent conversion rate and in the case of Landing clients to get the ball rolling I'd start without reaching to 100 potential customers per month pal I know that sounds insane but again you're 
[09:13](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=553) assuming a two percent conversion rate so out of the hundred people who may only land two of them and if you're just starting out Landing your first client is almost always the hardest part but 
[09:25](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=565) once you do land them this brings us to step three which is Network networking is probably the most powerful tool when it comes to the business side of 3D it's what allows for repeat business and it 
[09:38](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=578) expands your potential clientele almost exponentially so once I've made it to this stage I'd reach out to the clients I've just finished work with and set them as simple DM something like hey 
[09:49](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=589) thanks for working with me do you happen to know anyone else needing my services if so do you mind passing my info along thanks a bunch and looking forward to working with you in future best smeef 
[10:01](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=601) you don't have to overthink this part nine times out of ten they will know someone and they will refer you to them and this is the power of effective networking you can get repeat business 
[10:12](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=612) from a tight-knit community of Brands and it'll get to a point where you have too many people wanting your service this then allows you to refer them to other 3D artists in your community or 
[10:23](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=623) even expand your business further with subcontracting or employees but that's a whole other video in and of itself now all of this is a great blueprint but there's actually a secret bonus level 
[10:34](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=634) that not only helps you earn 10 times more with 3D but it fixes the number one problem I see almost every freelance artists make if you'd like to learn how to fix that you'll want to watch this 
[10:45](https://youtu.be/1WOVNkJQEAQ?si=-3WMbh-NT9oWqTEH&t=645) video right here [Music]

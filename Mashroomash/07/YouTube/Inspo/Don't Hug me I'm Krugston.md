--"Why Don't Hug me I'm Krugston?"
Dude I remember finding Don't Hug me I'm Scared for the first time and instantly falling in love. Becky and Joe have such a unique creative vision for storytelling that it I couldn't help but pay a little tribute to a huge influence in what I do. If you're reading this - huge fan!

--"How many episodes of KRUGSTON UNIVERSE are there?"
Three (for now).

Commonly asked questions:
--"Hey Noah, any drawing tablet recommendations?"
Yeah Huion makes some good quality cheap tablets, and if it's in your price range, the Kamvas Pro 22 has been really good to me (It was sent to me for free like 3 years ago and it still KICKS.)

--"I want to animate, but I need animation software recommendations because I can't use GOOGLE"
I use ToonBoom Harmony: https://www.toonboom.com/products/har...

--"Sure, but I need to be able to edit my eccentric dictator speeches with SOMETHING"
Use Resolve and take a chill pill bro: https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/prod...

Ay bois you know what time it is. This is a creepy animated cartoon about Don't hug me I'm Scared (DHMIS), a fake scary puppet show that features various animation and animated bits of various characters like Red guy, Duck, and Yellow guy and Roy featuring a parody song of compositions in the original series like the time song sung by the clock or the internet song by Colin the Computer or the song about creative colors (not green). Time to get creative, baby.

Thanks for watching my animation! It means a lot to me :)

Description:: Cancelled Disney / Pixar Movie: The story of stop-motion pioneer Henry Selick's cancelled & unreleased ''THE SHADOW KING.''  

In 2011, The Shadow King was green-lit for production. Selick and his highly talented crew would begin work at Cinderbiter Studios on what was shaping up to be a masterpiece in the vein of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' & 'Coraline.'  

After spending a reported $50 million, and due to unspecified concerns over future costs and benefits, Walt Disney Pictures cancelled the project in August 2012.

[08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=530) stunning work she produced during the pre-production of the Shadow King Lou Romano would later put up an extraordinary blog entry showcasing some of the artwork he produced on the shadow 
[09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=550) king between 2010 and 2012 [Music] in August 2012 the news would break that Disney had abruptly shut down production despite the progress already made at the 
[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=744) cost of 50 million dollars James a resumed Disney's chief financial officer revealed at a gathering of Wall Street analysts that the company would take the 50 million dollar right down on the chin 
[12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=757) Razoo Lowe did not specify what prompted the movie write down saying only after looking at it we've decided we don't want to continue with it Brazil o wouldn't be pressed on the 
[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=768) reasons as to why but the truth is Brazil o was only the messenger the decision to completely derail and cancel the project was solely that of the new Disney chairman mr. alan horne the salic 
[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=781) deal was made under the previous regime chaired by rick ross and now things had changed the remit now was to focus on pre-existing franchises in order to make the maximum amount of money from 
[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=795) merchandise and brand tie-ins retailers was said to have been conservative in ordering products tied to the Avengers after Iron Man 2 products fared poorly and so now the worry was will kids be 
[13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=808) buying shadow king merchandise it was decided no it's too dark kids like colorful things so make more colorful things and so the trigger was pulled 
[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=819) 150 people lost their jobs and the studio's attention were diverted to promoting the release of Finding Nemo in 3d and record Ralph the news was heartbreaking it is often said that 
[13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=833) business is the enemy of creativity and this decision is one that would enforce that notion more than any other Lou Romano would say working on this stop motion and 
[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=845) feature was one of the most creative experiences of my career that the project was cancelled I learned a great deal and I am proud of what our small our department helped great artists 
[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=857) would eventually begin to release their contributions to the project online we saw paintings and thumbnails from Ming Zhu Helen Chen [Music] 
[14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=879) Katie Wu would release some of the brilliant illustrations and art she produced during the pre-production [Music] [Applause] 
[15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=919) [Music] one crew member would contact the animation guild blog saying I journeyed up to the shoot several weeks ago and things appeared to be going well 
[15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=939) the project was happening in the industrial warehouse section of San Francisco and the crew was up and engaged I have no idea why Henry's project was shut down so deep into 
[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=949) production but some person in a higher level of authority must have seen the dailies and said ah no I had a I had a project called The Shadow King that was being done with Pixar and Disney and it 
[16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=962) got shut down we were in production but they couldn't support my vision they loved Coraline and I presented and developed an original idea of mine but you know I absolutely have learned that 
[16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=981) I'm a collaborator but as director I get to choose if the idea goes in or not when there's an executive more powerful than me forcing me to do something in every case it 
[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=994) breaks the movie and canned ultimately destroy it my feeling is like give me this much money you know we agree on what this film's gonna be and you welcome to give me notes and have input 
[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1010) but let me decide and you'll have a better film it will be more successful and when you know one goes the other way it doesn't work meanwhile Variety reported that sources close to the 
[17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1024) production said from a creative and scheduling standpoint the pick wasn't where it needed to be to meet it's planned release date and Disney decided not to continue production as a result 
[17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1034) Steve Hallett of the international alliance of theatrical stage employees would say the Disney had contacted the union to inform them of the impending shutdown Hallett wrote I have no idea 
[17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1047) why Henry's project was shut down so deep into production whatever the actual reason we're saddened to see so animation professionals lose their jobs of a feature that appeared to be in full 
[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1057) flight here's hoping that mr. Selleck sets the feature up someplace else and folks can continue working upon Disney's departure Laika after the successful collaboration on Coraline was 
[17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1069) considering taking over the new project after Selleck was given permission to complete the film elsewhere now officially titled The Shadow King the director would screen a few minutes of 
[17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1079) footage that had already been shot on the incomplete project the following scenes were co-directed by Selleck and Eric Layton with work by Damon Barnes and the late Dave Osmond

[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1274) deaf I said rabble rousers is a fine salute do you know don't the girl she's real but she is really worried gotta get around that doorman there was hope the 
[22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1334) project would be picked up Selleck would try to revive production of the film by shopping the project at the European film market in Berlin the director would team up with beasts of the southern wild 
[22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1345) producer Josh Penn and enlist k5 international to represent the film's international rights a proposed cast of actors was revealed to include Pamela Adlon Brendan Gleeson Jeffrey Tambor 
[22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1360) Catherine O'Hara and Jaden beds as HAP Travis Knight who runs Leica unfortunately couldn't figure out budgeting to pull this project in and had to pass Selleck with a heavy heart 
[22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1372) would then send an internal memo to his crew informing them the project was over devastatingly the project wasn't picked up on the international market production would not resume and the 
[23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1385) puppet and sets would be destroyed as bitter pills go the shadow Kings cancellation is a particularly tough one to swallow there were literally no genuine or satisfactory reasons as to 
[23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1398) why the shadow Kings production would when you see how much love craft and creativity went into the work that had already been completed it's fair to say that the decision from high up to simply 
[23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1412) scrap everything is somewhat of a fear-based atrocity it is also further evidence of how deeply out of touch with the audience's executives tend to be when under 
[23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1423) estimating and thinking on behalf of the audiences the crew would move on to other projects and salic is currently working hard on Windell and wild for a 2021 Netflix release in which two demon 
[23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1439) brothers voiced by keegan-michael key and Jordan Peele escaped the underworld and find themselves in a town where they must evade a demon duster teenager cat who is trying to destroy them years 
[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1453) later at the Montreal stop-motion festival Selleck would reflect on the experience with mixed emotions saying let me just step back for a second and say that I never set out to have a 
[24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1466) Hollywood career and whatever bad experiences I've had which are plenty the good ones our work finally got to direct nightmare and 
[24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1475) I'd still be pretty damn happy because I got to take stop-motion places it had never been it's easy to belly ate them things haven't worked out but honestly I'm very grateful for the project I've 
[24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1487) gotten to work on the success that we have had with those projects and as for the rest of it it doesn't really matter that much and that concludes this story of Henry selects their shadow king 
[25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9AaR1XPjpA&t=1502) thanks for listening [Music]

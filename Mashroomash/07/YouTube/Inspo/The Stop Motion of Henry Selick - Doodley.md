(Description:: Stop motion as an art form is highly respected yet somehow always overlooked in cinema ‚Äì but one director has always tried to keep it alive, despite everything. With Henry Selick recently releasing his first film in 13 years, let‚Äôs take a deep dive into all his previous films and analyze not only how they‚Äôre made, but also the motivation and struggles that went into making them.)

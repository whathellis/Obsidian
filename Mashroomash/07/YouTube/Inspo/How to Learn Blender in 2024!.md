# Transcript
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=0) blender 3D is kind of overwhelming with things like geometry nodes simulation nodes animations sculpting modeling and more it can be hard learning where to get started with blender or how to 
[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=11) pursue more advanced skill sets in this video we're going to be going through the best places to learn blender in 2024 first we're going to go ahead and cover free learning resources then we'll take 
[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=20) a look at paid courses if you stick around to the end of the video I'll tell you what I think the three best blender tutorials were of 2023 let's dive in starting with the free stuff we have 
[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=30) this channel here not a YouTuber but a great Instagram resource for tutorials and tips next up this channel here has a variety of blender 3D topical content with a focus on realism and rendering 
[00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=41) cinematic scenes this more recent channel has some nice simple character sculpting tutorials now this channel doesn't post frequently but the few videos that they do post on here are 
[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=50) great insights into the process this channel has lots of tips on how to create epic sci-fi and environmental renders and blender not a ton of videos on this channel but some excellent 
[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=60) grease pencil breakdowns of some very cool scenes now this channel is mostly time lapses and YouTube shorts so not tutorials per se but they're very easy to learn from with a cool art style 
[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=70) another Instagram recommendation that posts frequently and fast tips for blender this channel here has an amazing free character creation and rigging courses and this is just paid quality 
[01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=81) education for free this channel gets a ton of views on every tutorial and for a good reason they're highquality VFX oriented tutorials with concise explanations I love this channel because 
[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=92) it's hilarious and entertaining all at the same time but it also has a lot of great tutorials usually focused more on animation and Motion Graphics another Channel full of great content with a 
[01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=104) variety of topics but specifically I love the material focused videos of this channel this Channel's been growing over the last year with a lot of awesome geometry node and like abstract type 
[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=115) tutorials which isn't super common so it's great to see channels tackling this content yet another Channel focused on that same type of geometry node content with a lot of advanced deep Dives and 
[02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=126) breakdowns of the process this channel is incredibly great if you want to really deep dive into the power of geometry nodes this channel here is run by professional who works in the 
[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=136) industry and shares a lot of knowledge the tutorials are professional grade deep diving into specifics of rigging and we'll be talking about this channel later as they also have some Great 
[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=146) Courses as well now here's one of the older blend channels that I actually used when I was first learning blender and they're still around doing a lot of great content they cover a variety of 
[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=157) blender topics and definitely worth checking out another variety Channel that's been around for a while with a lot of visual effects nodes and effects Focus tutorials they Deep dive into the 
[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=167) math behind the nodes a lot which is super helpful for not only teaching you how to make the content but understanding what you're making love this channel here with our focus on NPR 
[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=175) rendering style if you don't know what that means it's non-photo realistic rendering so so if you're interested in tune shaders or doing kind of 3D 2D effects this is a great channel for 
[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=185) learning now I love this channel specifically for its amazing product rendering tutorials which is something you don't see on many channels which is unfortunate because working in the 
[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=194) industry it's a large portion of the 3D work that I see on contracts blender Bob's Channel focuses on Technical and fundamentals of blender simple straight forward videos that just explain the 
[03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=205) technical aspects now this channel is mostly Unity but also uses blender and just tossing this channel in here because I get a lot of questions about unity in the comments so if that's what 
[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=214) you're interested in I'd recommend coming here this channel is always impress me with their short film demos but they use a lot of photo scans and visual effects to make some really cool 
[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=222) artwork on this channel and they also break down some of the process and there's a lot to learn there this channel does a lot of Motion Graphics character type work and shares the 
[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=231) process in the tutorials which is super helpful for learning love this channel for their simulation tutorials and in particular I really love this fire tutorial that they did a while back back 
[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=240) this channel has a lot of studio type work Focus tutorials on animation materials and more a great channel for grease pencil tutorials specifically on how to achieve certain Styles in grease 
[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=251) pencil including breakdowns animations tutorials asset packs and more now if you're part of the blender Community you've already heard of this channel however if you are new to the community 
[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=260) the blender donut tutorial is the Cornerstone of most blender beginners career opening so this is a great tutorial for first opening blender and kind of diving in to learn the interface 
[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=272) now this channel posts little secrets and tips and tricks every single day and 45 to 60-second increments and I find myself returning to this channel a lot just to refresh my memory on little tips 
[04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=283) and tricks that I've forgotten in the past yet another one of the biggest blender channels you've probably heard of but it does a mixture of entertainment and education making it 
[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=291) really fun to watch ducky 3D you're probably familiar with as well yet another huge Channel but if you're new to the community they cover lots of amazing Motion Graphics and material 
[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=301) tutorials here over on this channel it's great for efficient modeling videos and a lot of video game modeling series of tutorials doing edits and models for things like mobile games and how to 
[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=312) optimize those models just an incredibly great Channel overall with a variety of content but mostly focused on modeling and texturing this channel here has a lot of sculpting tutorials and time 
[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=322) lapses they also have some courses however I recommend checking this out for their amazing rendering and lighting style another one of the older channels that like I was using when I was 
[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=332) learning blender amazing lighting and hard surface modeling tutorials with a focus on realism lots of great professional content here this channel here does a lot of videos on correct 
[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=342) topology and hard surface modeling a lot of professional content that'll really help you produce high quality models and not just make artwork that looks good but is also functional in a production 
[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=352) pipeline this channel run by Curtis Holt covers the more technical sides of blender including development and add-ons but it's more more of a variety Channel with a lot of content mostly 
[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=362) related to blender Kev binge works in the visual effects industry and has a lot of videos revolved around VFX oriented scenes and blender bringing in a lot of knowledge they have from the 
[06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=371) industry creating some highquality content now I can't possibly cover every great YouTuber out there so make sure to comment the ones you think I missed in the comments below so next we're going 
[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=379) to dive into some paid resources these courses usually offer more advanced concised and focused education which can help speed up the learning process disclaimer some of these are affiliate 
[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=390) links first up I just want to suggest that I have courses on skillshare I'm working on some new courses this year and I gear them towards doing everything for the first time such as characters 
[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=399) rigging and animation with simple quick hour-long exercises I want to give a special shout out to ducky 3D's new course which is based off his old Motion Graphics course but new and improved 
[06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=410) increasing the lesson amount by twice and coming out January 1st 2024 with a discount it has a lot of great knowledge packed in I definitely re recommend you check it out CG cookie is probably where 
[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=421) I had the most success getting over that beginners hump this is really where I went to to learn in the beginning it's a subscription based service where you subscribe and you get access to a 
[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=431) variety of content from different creators very high quality and definitely a great point to speed up your learning process now we mentioned Pierre's YouTube channel earlier but 
[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=441) they also have some extremely Advanced courses on animation and rigging they just released a new Unreal Engine 5 course hosted on the same site for visual 
[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=451) effects if you're interested in that as well but I highly recommend the animation and the rigging course I own both of them CG boost has both free and paid resources and they just released 
[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=461) this awesome grease pencil course which I definitely want to check out this year it helps you render this amazing scene here while walking you through the entire process of mixing grease pencil 
[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=473) with 3D workflow and blender glove alexandr has three excellent courses on hard surface modeling photogram and lighting all of which I recommend and they're currently working on a new 
[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=483) course which is focused on creating nebulas which looks really cool now skillshare is a great site which also has a free trial they have a variety of content both on and off blender so if 
[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=494) you want to learn things like composition color marketing or design around the content that you're creating it's great for that as well I host some of my classes here as well which will be 
[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=504) linked in the description who better to teach blender than blender themselves blender cloud is a great resource for intermediate users looking to become Advanced they also put up all their 
[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=514) project files as part of the subscription and you get the benefit of knowing that you're supporting the wonderful people over at blender I rarely see flip normals appear on 
[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=523) blender resource list because they don't only cover blender but flip normals have some affordable and advanced courses on blender and other software that is incredibly useful if you're trying to 
[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=534) gain industry knowledge and take your work to a professional level all right so we've gone through all these resources but what do I think are the top three blender tutorials of 2023 well 
[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=545) check out these three so first up how to animate everything with absolute shape Keys one of the most popular tutorials on my channel is on shape keys and I love this tutorial which shares 
[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=555) additional info on the process of animating with shaped keys with entire animated shorts how to make procedural fur and blender 3.5 this works for current versions of blender as well but 
[09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=565) is it any surprise that blender Studio themselves would make great educational content of course not this is a fur tutorial which is perfect for getting started in the world of hair and blender 
[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=575) not strictly blender but animating legs walk cycles and weight by doodle is an animation focused tutorial that gives a lot of insight into digestible format on how to better improve your walk cycle 
[09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=587) animations and I recommend this for any blender user looking to animate what about you do you agree with my top three choices what would be your best blender 3D tutorial from this year comment below 
[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwGIxFjUMRc&list=WL&index=37&t=463s&t=597) also if you're struggling to learn blend just stick with it I promise it gets easier and hopefully these resources help speed up that process

(Description:: In this video I create a biologic organism field testing device. I 3D modelled it using Autodesk Maya and textured it using Adobe Substance 3D Painter.)
It was based off of a few images I found on google images.
3D model, working files and a real-time video including the full UV mapping process available on my Patron.

# Transcript
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=0) at the start of the animation marshmallow has very smooth and clean shape then when it starts to burn the bubbles start popping out everywhere after a while all sorts of drops and 
[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=12) snots starts to appear so let's try to stylize it somehow using standard Cinema 4D tools it is not very possible to deform these particular topologies so much that you can get bubbles and snots 
[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=25) that's why we're gonna use volume Builder and volume measure make sure that the body is selected then hold down alt and create volume Builder this tool simply fills the internal 
[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=38) volume of the mesh with voxels the voxel is simply a pixel but in 3D you can adjust the voxel size the lower the value the higher the resolution we need to pick the right value so that 
[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=53) the details are well read but not so low that it eats up a lot of Computer Resources now while the volume Builder is selected hold down alt and create volume measure 
[01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=71) the volume measure will just create a polygonal mesh based on a voxel-filled Surface the main advantage of the volume Builder is that you can drop a lot of different objects inside and it will 
[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=83) merge all the objects into a single mesh look how it repeats all the polygons of this sphere if you select volume Builder you can adjust some details for example we can 
[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=94) increase this radius and it will smooth the borders between the objects also you can create SDF smooth it'll just smooth the whole surface I think it's perfect solution for making those bubbles now we 
[01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=108) can create a bunch of spheres and sketch out some good composition I don't want to have too many objects in volume Builder and adjust every single object by hand and the good news is that you 
[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=120) can use nulls inside the volume Builder so let's create a null pair into volume Builder and put sphere inside I'll remove SDS smooth for now and now we have two objects body and now now if I 
[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=134) select the sphere and duplicate it it will appear inside the null and the volume Builder will work with all the objects inside this null if your computer is not very powerful you can 
[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=145) turn off the volume Builder and volume measure for now we need to think only about a good composition we have a static camera in this scene so we need to make it look good from the camera 
[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=157) perspective and it is unnecessary to model something that we cannot see from the camera it will take some time so I'm not going to show you how I arrange all the 
[02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=168) Spheres I'll just show you the final result after several minutes I have this result it is just a bunch of spheres parented to null which I renamed to Bubbles 
[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=182) notes that I did not do this from behind because we'll never see it from the camera perspective now let's see how it looks like with volume Builder 
[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=194) in object list you can find bubbles now and I'm gonna slightly adjust the radius to get a bit more drop shape like this let's disable the volume Builder and think about how we're gonna animate this 
[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=210) we need to make something that allows us to move all the Spheres out of the body in the first frame they will be inside the body and move out like this also I want to animate the scale of the Spheres 
[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=224) to inflate them at some point the best solution is plane effector let's create it and place inside the bubbles null now go to the format Tab and switch to object 
[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=237) this allows it to affect all objects that are inside the knob plane effector can move objects along arbitrary axis you can try X Y or Z but we need them to be moved towards or 
[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=252) away from the body let me show what we're gonna do I'll disable the plane effector for now if you select this tiny sphere and rotate it so that the y-axis looks towards the 
[04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=265) body then turn on the plane effector and in parameter tab switch the transform space to object it's still going to move it along y-axis but it will use the local 
[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=277) coordinates of each object that's why we need to rotate all the Spheres in the way that y-axis looks towards the body you can do it manually but there is a way to make it much faster let me show 
[04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=293) you just select all the Spheres then go to tags and create constraint tag make sure that all tags are selected then scroll down here and switch constraint type to aim we can use plain 
[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=309) effect as a Target just click here and select plane effector we want to point the y-axis towards the center of the body so select y Plus now if you select the plane effector and 
[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=321) adjust the Y position you can see that the Spheres move towards or away from the plane effector so we can place the plane effect to the center of the body 
[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=333) maybe slightly higher now we can animate the strength of the plane effector to push the Spheres out of the body I also want to animate the scale of the Spheres so select play an 
[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=346) effector go to parameter tab enable scale and then also enable uniform and absolute and set scale value to -1 now if you change the strength spheres will 
[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=360) not only move but also decrease in size we can animate this parameter but for me it looks so boring to make it much more interesting we can use Fields go to Fields Tab and create linear field 
[06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=376) if you move it along x-axis you can achieve this kind of effect let's see how it looks in the volume Builder looks pretty nice already but for me 
[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=387) they appear too evenly and I want to add more random let me demonstrate what we're gonna do on a simple example here I have very similar setup it just moves cubes along 
[06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=399) y-axis for instance let's create another field and this side we're going to use Shader field as a Shader I will use noise I temporarily turn off the linear field 
[06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=414) this is pretty obvious Shader field just moves all cubes based on noise Shader so now let's try to blend it with linear field I'll select plane effector and switch 
[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=427) the blending mode to Overlay then Shader Fields will only affect the gray area between 1 and 0. now we only need to adjust the parameters of the Shader I'll go to 
[07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=440) noise Shader I'll click this icon to undock the parameters to make it more convenient I want to adjust the low and high clip parameters it will add a bit more contrast 
[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=452) now let's do the same with marshmallow select plane effector and create Shader field as a Shader we're going to use noise now select plane effector and change the 
[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=466) blending mode to Overlay last time we talked about that Shader field works with UV coordinates but this time we don't have any UVS that's why go to noise Shader and switch space to 
[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=479) world now everything is correct so let's check how it works looks nice already but I want to adjust some parameters in particular I want to 
[08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=493) make the noise a bit more contrast adjust its scale and maybe play with seed parameter and maybe make the linear field a bit shorter I want to rename the plane effector to 
[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=520) activate bubbles and in my case it looks something like this on animation stage we're going to animate the X position of the linear 
[08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=529) field now let me demonstrate how do we go about making those hangings nuts while experimenting with the volume Builder I noticed that if you create a sphere and 
[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=540) a cylinder and place it like this inside volume Builder it is already looks quite similar to what we need to enhance this effect can use something like SDF smooth it has a few settings you can experiment 
[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=553) with this to achieve the result you want and as you see it looks like a slime drop I want to make a setup that will allow us to move the sphere down like this and 
[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=563) adjust the cylinder automatically I want it to get thinner as it lengthens and also it would be awesome to make it bad now I'll remove what I made and it will be much more convenient to create this 
[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=576) setup in new project but first let's create a sphere and right away make it approximately the same size as in the test in my case it's about 13. hold down control or command 
[09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=588) the Mac to duplicate and rename one to start and the other to end in the test I used cylinder but this plan is much more flexible so let's create an empty spline 
[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=601) then switch to points mode then hold down Ctrl command on Mac and click three times like this now we got spine with three points I'll immediately switch type to cubic 
[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=613) and intermediate points to uniform I want to control the position of the points using objects in particular I want to control this point with this sphere and the other point respectively 
[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=626) and this Middle Point will be controlled by some kind of controller that will allow us to bend this spline so now let's create a null and rename it to snot select all objects and place it 
[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=638) inside the null then select the null and create expresso tag to control the points of this plan we're going to use Point node just type point in the search bar then drag it and drop into editor it 
[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=651) is not very complicated it has two inputs the object we want to modify the index of a point we want to move and let's add third input which is position in which we want to place the 
[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=664) point we want to modify the spline object so drag and drop it into expresso hit the red square and find object we will use it as an object input of the 
[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=677) point node now drag and drop the object we will use to control the point we're going to use its position so hit the red square and find global position and the index of the point we want to 
[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=690) control will set manually in our case we have three points and indexing starts from zero so we can choose between 0 1 and 2. first let's choose index 0. 
[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=704) and then try to connect everything object to object and position respectively now let's recap the point node takes the point with index 0 and places it into 
[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=715) position of the start object that's why we need three point nodes one for each point you can duplicate them by holding down Ctrl command on Mac we'll use the same spline object so let's connect it 
[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=728) we still have no controller for the midpoint but for now drag and drop the and object I also forgot to change the indices so this is one and the last will be two 
[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=739) create the global position output on the Node called and then connect it to the last point the one with index 2. now let's check how it works 
[12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=752) the midpoint still not controlled by any object is controlled by this point node so let's create a null and rename it to Middle then set the shape to cube to make it 
[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=768) visible in viewport then drag and drop it into espresso and move it inside snot add Global position output and then connect it to the point 
[13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=781) position of the point node now we can control midpoint we're going to use it to bend our snot let's give this plant some thickness just select spline hold down alt and create sweep 
[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=796) this is the same approach we used for the lips just create a circle and adjust its radius now I'll select all the objects and 
[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=809) reset all local coordinates let's take a look how everything works I want to animate the end and the middle to change the shape of the snot if you have glitches like this just 
[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=823) select sweep object go to attributes then scroll down here and uncheck everything except banking you can also disable caps okay let's see what we got we can 
[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=840) control and and the middle and basically we can use this for animation but we will have a lot of snots that we will have to animate manually that's why I want to automate as much as possible for 
[14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=852) instance I can make this middle part to be animated automatically for this let's select it and create constraint tag then go to attributes and enable 
[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=863) transform go to transform Tab and as a Target select start object next hit add and the next Target will be and notice that now we cannot change its 
[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=876) position because it's controlled by two objects at the end and the start and it always in the middle between them you may notice that when I move the end the middle is a bit lags behind this is 
[14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=889) because the espresso takes the position of the null before the constraint attack changes it to fix this we need to change the execution priority select the espresso tag and here you can see 
[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=901) priority and I'll set it to 5. the main idea is to set it higher than the priority of the constraint tag this way the expresso tag will set positions of the points after constraint type set 
[15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=916) position of the middle okay now we have the middle always in the middle and it's still not very helpful but what if we select constraint tag and 
[15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=926) go to transform tab and turn off the x and z position so we'll keep only y position this way it will be moved only vertically and we got this bendy motion 
[15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=940) for free and now all we need to animate is just and object if you want you can adjust its position between and and start to do so go to 
[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=953) constraint tag and play with these two sliders you can move it closer to and or closer to start so during animation all I have to do is just take this and object 
[16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=967) and move it along some circular path like this I want to organize it a bit so select the end object hold down alt and create a null and call it add 
[16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=983) select some shape I want to use sphere and make it a bit bigger than the sphere it will help us later with the volume Builder now let's do the same for the start object 
[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=994) create a null and call it start select some shape and then scale it up a bit now let's correct some parameters of the sweep object I want to make the radius 
[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1013) of the circle the same as the radius of the Spheres in my case it is 13. and also I want to adjust the shape of the sweep scroll down to details Tab and here you can find scale I'll just create 
[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1029) one point in the middle and move it down a bit I just want to make it a bit narrower in the middle next we're gonna make this sweep thinner as it stretches in other words when it 
[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1046) becomes longer the radius will decrease for this we're going to use espresso double click on espresso attack and the thickness of this knot is basically the radius of the circle so let's drag the 
[17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1058) circle and drop into expresso we're going to control the radius so drop it as an input the thickness will depend on the distance between these two knots so we 
[17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1069) can immediately drag and drop the start now and the end null we're going to use its positions but this time we're not going to use Global positions instead go to coordinates Tab 
[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1081) and use position from here make sure your drag letter P not X Y or Z we use local positions because I want to be able to scale this knot note that when I scale it the global position 
[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1096) between two nulls changes since the radius depends on the distance it will also change but I want to keep it the same while scaling measuring distance between two positions is pretty 
[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1107) straightforward just find distance node then drag it inside espresso and connect positions to inputs if you connect the distance to the radius 
[18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1120) the radius will be the same as distance between these two knots so let's check and this is too big of course we need to make it so that when the distance between them is zero the radius is 13 
[18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1133) and when the distance is large the radius is zero for that we're going to use the node called range mapper tap it in the search bar and drop here let's pass the distance through range mapper 
[19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1145) it doesn't change anything yet let's look at the parameters if the input is zero the output will be zero and if the input is 1 the output will be also one at first we need to figure out how far 
[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1159) do we need to move the end so that the radius becomes zero for instance I want to use this particular distance so I want to know its value for this we can use result node just connect the 
[19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1171) distance to the input and you can see it here when I move the end now you can see that the value changes so let's use something about 200. so when the distance is 200 the radius 
[19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1188) should be zero now let's set up the range map so the minimum distance is zero and the maximum is 200. and when the distance is zero we're gonna set our radius to 13. 
[20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1204) and when it's 200 the radius is zero now let's check when I move it closer the radius is 13 and when it's 200 centimeters away the radius becomes zero just in case go to 
[20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1218) no Tab and enable clamp lower and upper to avoid some negative values for now we have linear dependency between distance and radius but I want to keep the radius 13 a bit longer and 
[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1232) then make it drop quickly at the end to remap the values we can use this spline section just hold down Ctrl or command and Mark and click to create points and then you can adjust the shape of the 
[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1243) Curve for instance if I shape the graph like this at the start the value will not change much but closer to the end it will drop 
[20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1253) let's see how it looks at the start the radius is almost the same and then it quickly drops to zero I want to adjust the shape a bit more and maybe correct the max distance a bit 
[21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1273) I'm just imitating the animation and seeing how radius changes looks pretty good so let's create some temporary animation the first frame I'll just zero out all 
[21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1290) the local coordinates now let's set animation slider to something like 25 and set a keyframe then go to frame 35 move the end down along y-axis and then 
[21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1305) set a keyframe then in frame 30 move it aside a bit like this and set a keyframe let's play the animation I know this is really boring animation and ideally we need to add some frames 
[22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1322) after to make some secondary motion but as always I want to automate everything I can that's why make sure that the end is selected 
[22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1333) and create track modify attack in Tech tab set strength to something around 50 and set the mode to string let's play the animation 
[22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1349) and you can see that this tag automatically adds the secondary motion let's adjust some parameters there are not so many if you increase stiffness it will become more rigid 
[22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1369) the drug is something like air resistance the strength is obvious and I will pick the values that I like visually I noticed a little issue you can see 
[23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1385) that the middle is a bit laggy it should be always in the middle between start and end but when the end in the secondary motion the middle stays in place this kind of issues is always 
[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1397) about priority we need to execute the constraint tag after the track modifier tag let's check the priority of the check modifier tag it is zero so let's set the priority of 
[23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1410) constraint talk a little bigger I'll set it to 1 and it still should be less than espresso priority let's play the animation and looks like everything is correct 
[23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1424) you know what I just realized that we will never use this now so in object tab let's set the shape to none and it will be much more convenient to make the snot null visible it allows 
[23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1436) us to select the entire snot in viewport we almost done with the snot setup I just want to organize everything and do some cleanup I want to remove animation 
[24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1449) for that hold down shift and hit F3 to select all animation tracks you have and delete next I want to add some user data we will have a lot of snots and other 
[24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1465) objects and I don't want to search all these tags every time I want to change some parameter for instance I want to be able to adjust this input upper parameter which is the maximum distance 
[24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1476) because we will duplicate move and scale different nodes and they probably will have different maximum distance when the radius becomes zero if you want it will be convenient to 
[24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1489) move this spline to user data it will add more control without opening the espresso editor and the last thing I want to be able to disable the track modifier because sometimes it's very 
[25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1502) hard to animate when it's enabled so select this nut now go to user data and add user data the first parameter will control the max distance so I'll leave float the unit is 
[25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1515) real the Min is 0 and the max let's try 300. and let's call it max distance I also set default value to 200. let's add another data this time set 
[25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1531) type to Boolean this is just a check box we're going to use it to disable track modifier let's call it simulation and the last data type I'll set the 
[25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1547) spline it has no any parameters so let's just call it something like remap hit OK we got user data tab 
[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1562) we're going to use max distance parameter to control the input upper in range mapper so let's drag and drop this knot now and then create the max distance output 
[26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1579) actually let's drop everything simulation and remap now we need to add inputs to range mapper we're going to control input upper so 
[26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1595) hit the blue box and create input operate and then connect it to max distance also I want to control this spline shape so let's add spline input 
[26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1609) and connect it to remap and simulation will control track modifier tag so let's drag and drop it into expresso editor 
[27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1620) add checkbox we want to control and connect it to simulation let's check how it works track modifier is enabled if we disable simulation back modifier is also 
[27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1634) disabled let's also adjust max distance I'll just check how it moves and adjust it based on the movement when we connected the remap it was reset so let's create this plan again 
[27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1653) and adjust the shape a bit the setup is done select all objects and zero out our local coordinates I'll move and down a bit along y-axis 
[27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1672) then turn off the simulation so that it doesn't interfere during the animation now we can copy it and paste into a regional project 
[28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1683) you can move it around and maybe adjust some parameters after that let's create null parented to volume Builder and rename to snots 
[28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1696) then place our snot inside if you enable the volume Builder you can still see the nulls you can make it invisible if you want to see the shape better 
[28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1709) or you can make it visible to select and manipulate it in viewport next we're going to prepare the project for animation in attributes go to mode project and set 
[28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1724) fps to 12. I'll disable volume Builder to save the Computer Resources I also want to adjust viewports a bit in panels menu I want to switch it to side-by-side views and I'll 
[28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1736) switch the Right View to front this way we can animate it here and see it in the left from the camera then create a plane and place it like this we're going to use it for reference 
[29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1746) animation expand material manager and create standard material then drag and drop it into plane in material attributes in color tab select 
[29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1758) texture heat load image and select the file with reference animation the proportions of the plane are wrong and proportions of the video is 16 over 
[29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1770) 9. so we can set 160 over 90 and then just scale it up a little you can place it as you want maybe like this if you scroll the timeline slider you 
[29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1783) can see that the animation is not playing to fix this go to material attributes and in viewport tab enable animation preview 
[29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1798) let's see how many frames do we have animation ends at the 50th frame so I'll leave 55. if you want to change the amount of frames go to mode project and you can set it here 
[30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1813) we no longer need the materials manager and if you want to switch display shading modes for instance wireframe but you want the plane to still display the animation 
[30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1824) select plane and create display tag in attributes enable use and select display shading mode I'll use constant shading now we can switch between display 
[30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1838) shading modes but you will still see the animation let's start with mouth before that we created a postmorph tag and basically we can use these sliders 
[30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1852) to change the shape of the mouth in different frames but this time I want to use different approach in different cases we can use different 
[31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1861) approaches to animate the mouth for instance we can create very complex system with a lot of controllers which will allow us to have very precise control over every little expression but 
[31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1872) it takes a lot of time to create such system and it's very hard to control a lot of Animation tracks the other approach is to use postmorph Tag you've probably heard another term called blend 
[31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1883) shapes this approach is very useful for lip sync because in this case we need to animate a lot of repeating shapes we can have a shape for every vowel and consonant and blend those shapes using 
[31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1896) blend shapes if you want you can use postmorph Tag to do this just switch to edit mode then add new pose then you can use modeling or sculpting 
[31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1907) tools to shape as you want then in postmorph tag you can rename this pose then switch to animate and you can animate these sliders then hit shift plus F3 to reveal the 
[32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1923) dope sheet to set a keyframe set the animation slider to the frame you want then hit this little Diamond icon near the parameter you want to animate the parameter that you animate it should 
[32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1935) appear in this list it will contain all animated parameters now I can change the value of the parameter and set another keyframe in different frame the value will be interpolated between 
[32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1947) two keyframes switch to curve mode if you want to see the interpolation curve in this mode you can adjust interpolation curves for instance if I shape it like this it starts to change 
[32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1959) very slowly and then go rapidly or in this case it will start very fast and then slowly goes to 100 percent but in our case I want to use different approach notice that we literally have 
[32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1974) about 10 or 12 mouth animation frames and it is not very convenient to create a lot of different pulses in Posner of tag for each of which we will have a separate animation track that's why I'm 
[33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=1988) going to remove the post Murph tag and use Point level animation let's switch back to dope sheet to enable Point level animation this button should be gray and all others should be 
[33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2001) blue by default it looks like this so we just need to enable Point level animation and disable everything else now when I create a keyframe in frame 0 you can see new animation track called 
[33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2015) pla it contains positions of all points of the object if you set time slider to a different frame adjust the position of the points and then create a new 
[33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2027) keyframe it will store new positions and will interpolate between two keyframes this way we can create new poses very quickly without creating new Sliders in postmort tag but there is a drawback we 
[34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2040) can't control the interpolation Curves in pla it is always linear but in this case it's not so bad we'll animate in 12 frames per second and we will fix the shape of the mouth in every 
[34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2053) frame manually you can quickly scroll the slider change the shape create a keyframe you can also move or duplicate keyframes while holding Ctrl or command and mac and some 
[34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2065) little mistakes and irregularity will add a little hand drawn or puppet animation vibe so now let's try to animate it in our project but first I'll remove the 
[34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2077) postmurph tag I'm going to animate in front view so that the spline always stays flat this is necessary for the band modifier to work correctly the first let's adjust the shape for the 
[34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2089) first frame overall it looks pretty much the way it should now let's enable the point level animation these buttons should look like this 
[35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2100) now let's create a keyframe and then move it into zero next let's find another important keyframe it's something around frame 28 then switch to points mode 
[35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2114) then use modeling or sculpting tools to mimic the shape from the reference when it's done set a keyframe at frame 28. and we got linear interpolation between two keyframes 
[35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2145) next I'm gonna find the last frame where the mouth is closed and then duplicate the zero frame and move it here the next keyframe will be where The Malt 
[35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2158) is open in my case it is 24 so let's call this shape I'll temporarily disable teeth and when you're done with this pose don't forget to create a keyframe 
[36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2176) right before the frame 24 it looks very similar to the first frame so I'll duplicate it here and I'm going to make a little anticipation before it opens I'll just slightly push it up 
[36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2190) and maybe narrow it down a bit I always look at the left view to see it from the camera don't forget to set a keyframe I don't like this linear motion much but if you 
[36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2204) like some frame in between you can hold down Ctrl command on Mac and click I get a new keyframe which I moved to 20. this way you can blend different shapes I also want to adjust the frame 24 a bit 
[37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2233) the next key pose will be in frame 25 I'll just reuse the frame 28 and adjust it a little using sculpting tools I also want to make a little overshoot 
[37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2253) before frame 28 for this I'll duplicate it and slightly push the corners of the mouth down let's see how it looks I have such draft animation looks nice 
[37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2279) in general I just want to tweak some poses and then we'll move on to the next keyframe here I'll speed up the video I'll just refine some shapes to make it 
[38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2291) smooth and to achieve smooth transitions between frames sometimes I shift some frames in time to achieve a nice rhythm the next key pose is when he starts to 
[38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2318) scream it's about 38 the same here just make a pose and set a keyframe let's see in which frame there is still 
[38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2335) a pose from the frame 28 it is about 35 so let's duplicate it here and also duplicate it into 36 to make a little anticipation before he starts to scream update a keyframe 
[39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2351) and I'm gonna tweak all poses a bit after some tweaks I got this animation let's analyze it a bit in frame 19 I have neutral pose in next frame we've got some 
[39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2373) anticipation the mouth tightens and the tension builds up to the frame 23 and when we get to the frame 24 it instantly opens after that the corners of the mouth go down 
[39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2385) then it bounces up a little and we get to the keyframe in frame 28. then it keeps this pose up to frame 34. a little anticipation in frame 36 and in 38 he starts to scream I also 
[40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2402) want to add some shaking motion to the lower lip when it screams I'll just select the bottom points and shake it like this just move it up a bit 
[40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2413) then set a keyframe now we have two keyframes and we can just select them and duplicate a few times I like the way it looks in general so 
[40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2431) I'll leave it like this for now now let's enable teeth and see what happens to them it looks good almost everywhere the first thing that I want to do is to 
[40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2443) scale them down a bit if you remember we need to select nut nulls but geometry I'll switch to object mode then activate scale tool and to scale them individually enable this checkbox 
[40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2459) on a reference on a lower jar we have three teeth so let's duplicate one of them and I'm gonna call it too slow meat then go to align to splend tag and 
[41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2473) adjust its position next I'm going to fix all positions and orientations of all teeth just remember to rotate geometry not nodes 
[41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2489) and to move it along spline use a line to spline tags notice that I adjusted for the frame 28. that's why let's select all align to spline tags 
[41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2503) and animate the position in this Frame now let's see how it looks in another frames in 25 it looks awesome that's why we can set a keyframe here and we need to fix 
[41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2517) the frame 24. let's set a keyframe at frame 25 then go to frame 24 and looks like we need to fix not only position but also orientation let's fix position sets 
[42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2531) first don't forget to set a keyframe after you made some changes now we're gonna fix the orientations let's select the geometry and figure out 
[42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2548) the axis of rotation we want to fix but before we fix it we need to set keyframes on those frames where we are already happy with the orientation we're going to rotate along 
[42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2561) these blue axis which is B so before let's go to frame 25 and set a keyframe here and then do the same for all the t's we want to fix 
[42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2575) after that I can go to frame 24 rotate it the way I want and set a keyframe I'll check other frames and in my case everything looks good 
[43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2605) now we're going to animate the tongue it starts to appear approximately in 37 38 frame now let's make it visible and at first I'll select the null and adjust its position and orientation 
[43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2621) in my case it is already looks quite good after that I'll tweak the band modifier to give it organic shape I'll temporarily disable displacer and 
[44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2641) we're gonna animate Roll Along y-axis to make it roll out first let's create a keyframe for the final pose when it's unrolled I'll do it in a frame 40. now select 
[44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2657) roll and set a keyframe for coordinate y it will start to roll out in frame 38 so adjust the y coordinate and set a keyframe I also want to animate band strength to 
[44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2675) add a little secondary motion are slightly unbend it in frame 40 to make a little overshoot in the frame 38 it will be cured inward and in for the second frame it will get 
[44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2690) the final pose I'll make Bend and roll invisible and enable displacer select a Shader field which is responsible for the waves and will 
[45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2713) animate spline of set I'll speed up the video and I'll just set two keyframes and pick such values so that I like the animation 
[45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2735) then I'm gonna make it invisible before it starts to roll out it will happen probably in frame 37 or 36 just select the tongue now and we're going to animate these two 
[45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2746) parameters in 37th frame I'll set it to default and in frame 36 I'll set it to off and the last thing I want this place are not to deform the object during the 
[46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2764) rolling out for this I'm going to animate its strength in frame 42 I will set it to 100 percent and in 38th I'll set it to zero I'll use dope sheet to tweak some frames 
[46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2780) you can use shortcut shift plus F3 on this list you can see all animated parameters but if you click this icon it will show only those you selected in object manager I'll select the spline 
[46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2793) and I want to reduce the movement of the lower jar so that it doesn't intersect the tongue so much I think tank appears too early you can see some intersection with the lips so 
[46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2816) I'll select the tongue now and move visibility keyframes one step forward before we start animating eyes I want to move the parental in the middle between two eyes 
[47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2836) for this hit enable access select the eyes null and move it right here we need this to be able to scale both eyes simultaneously in object mode 
[47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2852) I'm not going to rely heavily on the reference I will try to match it with the mouth animation disable Point level animation and enable everything else 
[47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2863) we're going to animate scale make sure you use object mode at first I'll set a keyframe right before the mouth starts to change in my case this Frame is 19. while the tension of the lips grows I 
[47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2876) want the eyes to get smaller and smaller before they blow up so I'll set the time slider to frame 23 and scale it down a bit then set a keyframe 
[48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2887) then in 24th they will blow up scale it up and set a keyframe also duplicate the frame 24 to the point where the corners of the mouth goes down 
[48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2905) in my case this is the frame 28 and in this Frame I'm gonna make it a bit smaller maybe not so much let's animate the eyes rotation 
[48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2929) don't forget we need to animate connect objects not nulls let me just check the frames where they start to scale at first I'll set the keyframes of neutral poses in frame 19. 
[49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2943) I want them diverge a bit while shrinking so let's set the time slider to frame 23 then rotate the eyes and set keyframes 
[49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2958) I think it adds more tension before they blow up the next key pose is in 28 I'll just mimic the pose from the reference next we can adjust the shape of the 
[49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=2984) pupils using user data we created at first I'll select both eye nulls and set keyframes for all parameters in frame 19. in 23rd frame I will slightly decrease 
[50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3003) the size of the pupils and in 24th they will grow up and I also add the waves effect let's find ffd deformers and make it visible 
[50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3045) and this time we're going to use Point level animation so let's enable it then switch to point mode and I'm going to use the magnet tool notice it works with several selected objects at first as 
[50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3058) always I will set a keyframe in frame 19 you should get pla animation tracks let's immediately duplicate these keyframes into 23rd 24th and 28 also 
[51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3081) in the frame 28 I'm gonna Define the shape so that they look a bit melted like in the reference let me remind you that when I sculpt I look at the left view to see it from the 
[51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3103) camera and don't forget to record the keyframe now I want to make a smoother transition between these two frames that's why I'll duplicate the frame 19 into 22. 
[52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3121) and adjust the frame 23 I just want to make a fill that it starts to fill with the air right before they blow up let's see how it looks 
[52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3147) I think they blows up too slow so I'll select all animated objects and then move frame 28 to 27. and I'll tweak the shape a little more in every frame 
[53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3192) everything looks nice already so I'll leave it like this let's move on to another pose the left eye is going to be puffed up like a balloon and the right will be blown away and flattened 
[53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3204) first I'm gonna find the last frame where this stays the same it is a frame 36 then I'll select both ffds and duplicate last keyframes into frame 36. 
[53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3230) and the final shape I'm gonna make in frame 40. I'll set a keyframe and then reshape the other ffd I think it's too slow so I'll adjust the 
[54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3254) timing next I'm going to animate the rotation of the eyes I'll duplicate the last keyframes as always 
[54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3285) and in 39th frame I'll rotate it as in reference and the last thing I'm going to animate the shape of the pupils as always I'll set keyframes in frame 36 
[55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3324) and then change their shape in frame 39. I also want to fix the orientation of this eye in frame 39 to make the pupil more visible and for the right pupil I want to 
[56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3379) animate the rotation parameter when he starts to scream I want to fix a lot of stuff but it takes a lot of time so I hope you get the general idea and make it better 
[56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3403) the last thing I will probably fix is teeth visibility I want to make them invisible before the mouth opens for that I'll just select the teeth now 
[56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3416) and then animate these two visibility parameters I will do the same with the middle tooth I want to make it invisible when the tongue appears 
[57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3447) when the face is done let's animate bubbles for that I'll enable activate Bubbles and we're gonna animate this linear field I will just animate the position along 
[57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3459) x-axis this is pretty straightforward I'll just create two keyframes and it will move from left to right now the animation is not very expressive and I want to add some secondary motion 
[57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3476) to do that we can use delay effector just place it inside bubbles now and in the format tab set object an effect to tab switch mode to Spring it affects all objects in parent now now 
[58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3496) we can see some secondary fluctuations now I'll hit play and will correct different parameters for instance I'm going to adjust keyframes of the linear field 
[58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3508) you can also adjust the noise and Shader fill to make it more random and maybe play with the length of the linear field to make this effect shorter or longer 
[58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3533) before we start animating snots let's analyze the animation at first only once not appears and after a while we can see others it will be easier to animate one than 
[59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3546) duplicate it and pick some parameters let's figure out when it should appear I think it's when all the bubbles appeared now let's adjust its position to make it look good from the camera 
[59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3567) just make nice composition we will animate this null called and so at first let's set a keyframe in the final position then go back few frames 
[59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3591) move it up and set the keyframe I'll just reset the local coordinates in this Frame and then somewhere in the middle move it aside a bit 
[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3603) this way we got this kind of Arc motion now let's see how it looks with simulation enabled I'm going to use user data we created I don't like how simulation looks for 
[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3619) now so I have to tweak the parameters of the track modifier as you see it is good that we didn't make a lot of copies of this node we 
[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3630) will fix and animate one and then we'll start to duplicate it looks not bad in general but I want to make this motion more expressive so I'll move it a bit further in the middle 
[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3656) frame and then add a bit more keyframes in the middle to make this Arc rounder I also think it appears a bit late so I'll select all the frames and move it a few steps back 
[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3681) let's see how it looks with volume Builder it will slow computed down a bit but I think we can see the general idea now we can see the snot before the bubbles but we'll fix it later I want to 
[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3703) disable the simulation before this knot starts to fall out in my case it starts to fall out in frame 28 so let's select the slot now and animate the simulation parameter and I will disable it one 
[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3716) frame before if you want to see the animation in real time in volume Builder we can temporarily cache the animation let's make this not now invisible to 
[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3733) hide the null from the viewport now if I play the animation it is very slow let's try to Cache it select volume Builder 
[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3745) go to object Tab and create cache layer then enable animation set it from 0 to 55 and then hit cache and now we can see the animation 
[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3765) and you know what I just noticed that the bubbles appears too late I want to shift the entire animation of Bubbles and snot two or three frames back in time 
[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3782) this is also pretty straightforward I'll just select all animated objects select keyframes and move it three frames back in time and when the animation of this knot is 
[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3812) ready you can start to duplicate it I'm going to duplicate them in a final frame to be able to see the final composition other snots should appear when he starts 
[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3828) to scream that's why when you made the first copy select this knot then select all animated objects and then shift all keyframes in time to 
[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3839) the moment where he starts the screen in my case it is too late so we'll move it back a bit and then I'll add some uniqueness maybe rotate it a little 
[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3875) you can shift frames in time and also scale it a bit if you're gonna scale it make sure you use object mode this way you will change the local coordinates of the object 
[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3903) for some snots I will also change the animation in this case I just want to settle it down a bit and simplify the snots on the sides are the most 
[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3914) important and they should be very expressive because they affect the silhouette that's why I'll make them first and spend more time 
[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3924) the same here I'll rotate it differently and then offset the animation to make it appear in different moment and I will do the same with all other 
[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3937) snots I'm not going to show you how I did everything because it takes a lot of time and the work is pretty repetitive I'll just show you the final result 
[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3959) as a result I got this animation I separated the first note from the others and called it snot first and the others are inside the null called snots I did this because they appears in 
[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3976) different moments of time and I wanna animate their visibility the problem is that we can see them before the bubbles and we cannot animate visibility because it doesn't work with 
[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=3987) volume Builder let me demonstrate if I go to the last frame then turn up the visibility and enable the volume Builder it still generates a mesh based on it 
[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4000) and the best way to fix it is to use instances at first let's create a null and call it original snots then parent to body null 
[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4015) and place all snots inside then select snot first and create instance then do the same for other snots select the null and create instance 
[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4033) then Place both instances inside volume Builder and you can make original snots invisible and now we can enable and disable instances and it will affect the volume 
[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4045) Builder I also want to move it below the body in volume Builder object list so that the radius of the bubbles affects it 
[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4061) and now we can animate disabling of the snots the first note appears in frame 27 so I'll animate this parameter and disable it in frame 26. 
[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4080) then do the same with the others this time they will appear approximately in frame 29. just a few frames after the bubbles I'll throw in a couple more ideas how to 
[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4099) add more details to the animation for example when he starts to screen we can make the bubbles to flow down a little for this I'm gonna use another plane 
[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4110) effector now they moves along local coordinates but I want to move them down to fix it set transform space to effecta now the moves in effect a space 
[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4125) I'll just move them down a little along y-axis I want to make them a bit more random that's why I'll use Shader field and use noise as a Shader 
[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4140) and then adjust it as we did earlier and apple animate the strength parameter you can add some shaking to the stick for that let's create a null rename it to Pivot 
[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4189) and then Place everything inside except camera and reference plane now it's on the center of marshmallow but I want to move it to the left let's enable axis and move it like this along 
[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4202) x-axis I'm going to animate this kind of motion let's figure out the axis in my case it is B I want to lift it up a bit when he 
[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4214) starts to anticipate and then he drops down with little overshoot and secondary motion nothing complicated here I'll just mimic some damped oscillations 
[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4258) also you can add vibration when he screams select private null and create vibrate tag in attributes enable rotation 
[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4271) and set some small amplitude and you can see how it vibrates on all axis you can also adjust the frequency I probably decrease the amplitude 
[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4285) now we can animate the amplitude so that the vibration starts from certain frame right before he starts to scream I'll set the amplitude to zero and after several frames I'll set it to 1. 
[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4317) another idea we can add the skin folds under the lips for that select the spline of the lips and then create an instance then place it inside volume Builder 
[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4337) the volume Builder also works with splines select volume Builder find this plan in object list and you can adjust the radius it works very 
[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4348) similar to sweep generator we also need to add the band modifier so that it follows the shape of the face but for now I'll just move it down like this and then create new band modifier place it 
[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4361) inside and bend it a little harder so that it penetrates inside the face you can also adjust its scale a bit and if you want instead of Bend you can use FFG it is much more flexible 
[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4376) but the main idea is to use the instance of the spline so that it follows the shape of the lips and since we use an instance we can enable and disable it in different 
[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4398) keyframes let me show you a few more ideas you can experiment with for example I want to make the snots a bit smoother 
[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4439) but I don't want to use SDF smooth in volume Builder you can create a smooth modifier and place it inside volume measure it should be placed right before the 
[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4453) volume Builder as you can see it makes the mesh smoother but the good news is that you can use fills with this modifier for example I 
[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4464) can create linear field and this way I can smooth on the top part or only bottom part I'm gonna smooth the tips of this knots I'll move it a little lower to avoid 
[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4477) smoothing the bubbles this way you can use any modifiers for instance you can create displacer place it inside volume measure give it some noise Shader 
[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4502) and maybe add some kind of vibration while it screams you can also experiment with fills but this time I'm not going to do this try to experiment with all this stuff for 
[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuJTAhgEbk&t=4515) example try to create an ffd and try to deform the overall shape of the marshmallow this way you can create some melting effect

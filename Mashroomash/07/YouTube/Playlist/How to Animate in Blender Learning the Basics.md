(Description:: This tutorial on Blender Animation is designed for individuals who are new to Blender or Animation. Join me as we explore the fundamental aspects of animation and become familiar with the interface. We will delve into the 12 principles of animation and apply 5 of these principles in our Bouncing Ball tutorial.)

For your convenience, I have developed a complimentary blender bouncing ball rig specifically for this tutorial. Feel free to download the rig and begin practicing today.

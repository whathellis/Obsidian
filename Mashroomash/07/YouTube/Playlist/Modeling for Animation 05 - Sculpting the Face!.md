(Description:: In this video, we construct a simple blocking of the face using primitive shapes, then remesh the model in order to sculpt! I talk about the considerations to make while sculpting and also offer a  few insights about the process.)


We then cap it off by giving it a nice shiny material for rendering out a concept image!

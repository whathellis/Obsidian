(Description:: I've been doing character animation for my Blender tutorials for a year now, and I've gotten much better and faster. It's time to share my workflow. I talk about lip syncing, the NLA editor aka animation layers, modeling my character, and making assets.)

[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=0) hello there my name is Joey and I am a human you want to learn how I make these fabulous animations well hold on to your hat this one's going to be a doozy for about a year now I've been 
[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=16) making these animated character scenes for my videos and it actually started as a way of forcing myself to practice animation more and because of all this practice I've gotten much better and 
[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=26) faster and developed a workflow that could help you out that being being said I've never worked at an animation studio or with a team so don't expect industry advice I'm still very much trying to get 
[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=37) better and I cut a lot of Corners to save time but I promise this is practical advice especially if you're a beginner who's having trouble getting started I'll get into the specifics of 
[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=46) everything but first here's my basic workflow I always start with planning so I make a bulleted list of everything that I want in the video and then write a script after that I record the audio 
[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=57) of me reading it and bring it into Da Vinci resolve to pick the best takes and edit it down I almost always record the rest of the video first and just leave gaps for where the character scenes will 
[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=67) go then I export the audio for just those gaps and bring it into blender then I do the lip syncing for every scene in its own action with nothing else I save this as a few separate files 
[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=79) depending on what the location is and then I bring in all the assets that I need and animate everything for that location I'll usually layer a few actions in the nla editor like lip 
[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=89) syncing body movement the face and sometimes extra actions if the scene is complex then I render everything out and bring it back into Da Vinci resolve to finish editing okay so here's how I made 
[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=100) my avatar character I have a few playlists about character modeling rigging and animation so watch those for step-by-step tutorials but I personally start most of my characters with a 
[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=110) drawing so I made a few sketches to figure out the basic shapes I wanted and then recreated that in blender I like to Box model everything instead of sculpting and and I keep things as low 
[02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=121) poly as I can utilizing a lot of modifiers like the subdivision surface and solidify modifier I kept most of the body parts in separate objects because I wanted to make everything easy to edit 
[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=132) in case I wanted changes and this definitely came in handy because right now I'm on my 12th version and I update it all the time I made the eyes so they could rotate to the side of the head to 
[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=142) mayic 2D style cartoons I also made a few different eye models and put them in their own collection and then made a geometry node setup to switch between them then I used some drivers so that I 
[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=153) could switch between the eyes using these bones instead of all of this you could just key frame the visibility of the eyes over here but I like to do as much as I can in pose mode so I set up a 
[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=164) decent amount of drivers usually which I show how to do in this mouth rig video speaking of mouth rigs I use the method from that video for this character I made these shape keys and made it so 
[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=177) these bones control them with drivers I also have some parts weight painted so I can move the whole mouth area around like this and I recently changed it a little so these bones shrink wrap to a 
[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=188) different model of the head this head model doesn't have a mouth it's just smooth in the front so now I can move the bones more easily without the head getting too distorted I also have bones 
[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=199) with drivers for switching between ik and FK for the arms legs and head the wiggling Distortion effect that my character has is this geometry node setup that I put on all of the body 
[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=210) parts the noise texture sticks to the location of an empty that's attached to the headbone using a copy transforms constraint and this makes it so all the body parts have the same noise pattern 
[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=220) and don't overlap and I can move the Armature across the screen in pose mode without the wiggle getting too intense I also have a few bones to control the scale and strength and I mostly use 
[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=231) these for making him float away at the end of videos I did use it in the last video though to emphasize the impact of getting hit by this other character stop motion clay style renders seem common 
[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=243) and popular right now and I like that a lot but I wanted something a little different so that's why I chose this effect it also helps cover up some mistakes and the subtle movement makes 
[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=252) the motion a little less robotic for the shading there isn't anything really special about it the hair has a wave texture plugged into the bump and the glasses have transmission turned up to 
[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=263) make them see through a little metallic and some roughness so that they have that frosted look and I always render an e for these animations too so there's a lot more in these scenes than just my 
[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=273) avatar I made a whole ass Library full I made a whole asset Library full of stuff most of these assets are in the same file as my avatar so I can make sure the size looks right and I basically just 
[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=285) model stuff here and then Mark The Collection as an asset in the outliner I have a few rooms with lights and cameras set up and I have a bunch of props too like a phone doors and windows furniture 
[04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=298) and some bananas in the preferences I added this file to the asset Library so I can access all of this stuff more easily in other files so I can just drag and drop what I want basically for my 
[05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=309) avatar I usually set this to link and then create a library override over here without the library override it doesn't let you pose the Armature the benefit of linking is that if I update the 
[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=320) character in the original file it updates in all of the other files that it's linked to if I'm using a prop that I want to edit specifically for the scene then I set this to append instead 
[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=330) of linking it so that I don't have to edit the original model I usually do this for walls if I want to cut a hole into one for a door or something like that and you might have noticed that I 
[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=339) also have these other sections in the asset library and these are for character poses I talk about making and editing poses in this video but basically you pose the Armature and 
[05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=350) select all the bones you want to be part of that pose then add a new pose from the asset library right here then you can select it here or from the asset shelf to change change the pose and I 
[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=360) made poses to help me with lip syncing too having a pose Library helps save me a ton of time kind of like how learning with brilliant will save you a ton of time brilliant is sponsoring this video 
[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=372) and you should check it out because it's the best way to learn math science and other stem topics like programming data analysis and physics a lot of these topics come up when you're learning 
[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=382) blender like you'll hear about vectors all the time if you're working with Shader nodes or geometry nodes and if you want to make anything with the simulation Zone basic physics concepts 
[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=391) are going to make you seem like a pro to other people and you'll need to know some algebra for setting up drivers like I did with my rig in this video you'll see these topics all over the place and 
[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=400) if you learn about them with brilliant you'll have a much more seamless blender Journey it's easy to get started if you're a beginner just take their quiz and they'll find content that matches 
[06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=409) your skill level and interests the courses are very interactive which makes them easier to understand and if you get lost they give you hints and step-by-step instructions to help get 
[06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=419) you better back on track the quick bite-size lessons make it easy to fit them into your schedule even if you're busy and you can use your computer or phone so you can use brilliant pretty

[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=451) syncing I made a bunch of mouth shapes that work for certain sounds and you can find some quick mouth shape references if you search for phony mouth charts I don't have that many because I reused 
[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=462) some shapes for certain sounds like this one that I use for l n and D sounds and yes I lip sync manually if I designed my character differently I might have used the bake sound to fcurves trick from my 
[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=475) puppet style lip sync video but it didn't look very good in this case I know there are other automatic methods like using Nvidia Omniverse but I haven't used it so that's a topic for a 
[08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=487) separate video so I bring my audio clips into the video sequence editor and then show the waveforms by selecting the clip and checking this box over here I turn on audio scrubbing on the timeline and I 
[08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=500) also change this to sync to audio for all of these editors I like turning on this sync to visible range option so that they all scroll at the same time then I just go through and listen to the 
[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=511) sound for about a year now and try to match it with the right mouth shape I like to leave at least two or three frames between mouth shapes otherwise it looks too fast people Mumble a lot in 
[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=523) real life here now I've been making these so it actually looks more natural when the movement is subtle for about a year now I've been making these animated character scenes for my videos and I 
[08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=532) think it usually looks better to make the mouth shapes a little early also so I'm just focusing on matching The Sounds here if I want to add facial expressions for emphasis I always do that afterwards 
[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=543) as a separate pass once I get into a flow it doesn't really take too long like the last video had about a minute and a half of lip syncing and it only took me a few hours which might seem

[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=564) The Dope sheet and I start with a POS to pose approach which is basically focusing on the big gestures first so for some spots like this I'll have the hands out at the widest point and then 
[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=575) other spots I'll make a pose like this with the hands folded and then I'll just insert key frames for all of the body bones I also like to set this to constant at first so there isn't any 
[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=585) interpolation I think it helps get the initial timing right and I don't feel as tempted to fix the in between motion I just focus on the big poses first so I just go through and listen to the 
[09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=596) dialogue and try to emphasize certain parts by adding poses there and developed a workflow that could help you out I don't use video reference most of the time for simple stuff like this but 
[10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=606) I have a few times like for this one I was having a hard time making poses that felt natural so I recorded a video of myself just looking around I didn't really match the timing but it was 
[10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=617) helpful for getting poses that felt better when the poses and timing look good I switched the key frame interpolation to beer it looks bad at first but I have a trick and it's kind 
[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=627) of a hacky approach that use because it's fast and easy what I usually do is copy the pose and paste it so the transition is only five frames from one pose to the next this usually keeps the 
[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=639) rhythm looking good and makes it so that I don't have to go into the graph Editor to adjust the easing some movements do require more than five frames so I will adjust things that don't look right and 
[10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=649) sometimes I'll add in between frames to make motion paths a little cleaner so the hands don't like pass through the head or something like that whenever the Avatar looks to the side I move the 
[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=658) glasses and in the mouth so that they look like this and so I don't have to mess with the lip sync key frames I do this in a separate action and I'll mix it in the nla editor which I'll talk 
[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=668) more about in a bit when I'm happy with the Bas motion I'll start using the free wiggle bones add-on I usually enable it for the head the hands and the hair and it helps add extra motion like follow 
[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=679) through and some bounciness sometimes I'll key frame this stiffness value to make it affect Parts more or less and when it looks good I bake the motion and again I do that in a separate action so 
[11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=690) that it doesn't overwrite all of the other animation all right time for the nla editor so what is it and why do people hate it so much it stands for nonlinear animation editor and it's a 
[11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=701) way of mixing and layering actions a lot of people hate it because it's confusing and it's not designed very well blender already knows this and they're planning on redesigning it in the next few years 
[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=711) there are actually some blender conference videos about it but don't let that stop you from learning it now because it's very powerful and it's not not very hard once you get used to the 
[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=720) quirks plus when they do redesign it you'll basically already know how to use it because the concepts will be the same okay so I already talked about making actions you can do that in the dope 
[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=730) sheet by changing this to action editor so for the lip sync when I'm done I'll open up the nla and push this down which just means that it's turning it into a strip over here and you can always edit 
[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=741) it again by selecting it and pressing tab an important thing to know is that everything works from the top down so if you have two body animations the one on top will overwrite the one below but if 
[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=753) they don't use the same bones then they don't really interact with each other like I didn't insert any key frames for the mouth bones when I did the body animation so they aren't really 
[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=762) affecting each other if you want to move the tracks you can use the page up and page down buttons I know it's weird you can also click and drag the strips or press G to move them you can change the 
[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=773) type of mixing that's going on in this side panel replace will replace the action obviously but combine is good for mixing actions together and you can change the influence right here it will 
[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=785) insert a key frame and if you want to get rid of it or a change where it is then you can find it in the dope sheet or the timeline it's another annoying Quirk so for when the face turns 
[13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=795) sideways I make a separate action just for the glasses and this one mouth bone and set it to combine and this makes it so that the mouth bone can still move from the lip sync action but it's also 
[13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=805) making the mouth extra wide for these parts I used the nla editor a lot for this elevator scene I had this running action and when I wanted it to stop I key framed the influence going down the 
[13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=817) action above it is set to replace and I made it start with this pose from the running action and it's easier to see that if I mute the running so this action above is where I manually 
[13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=827) animated the transition out of the Run Cycle and into this action of stepping into the elevator I also have this bobbing motion and a separate action that's being combined with the other 
[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=836) actions below so that it could blend into it and change how intense it was this is the sort of thing that would be good if you wanted to always add subtle idle movements like breathing or swaying 
[14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=847) side to side you could basically just have a loop on top of everything else that you animated so yeah it's got some issues but it can do some really cool things like what I just showed and much 
[14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=858) more like it can also change the speed of actions repeat them and it has modifiers like the stepped interpolation one that could be good for making things look like stop motion at a lower frame 
[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=869) rate all right time saving tips a lot of the tips I've already mentioned were things I didn't always do and these animations used to take a lot longer first is to just plan ahead and think of 
[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=880) what you might reuse in the future like my character took a while to make but I knew I'd use it a lot so I made sure the mouth would work for lip syncing and I have it set up in a way that lets me 
[14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=890) alter it easily making a lot of reusable poses saves time and I also have some animations like a walk cycle that I reuse by appending it to files where I need it all of the props are reusable 
[15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=902) including the rooms cameras and lights and I changed my startup file so the animation tab has things set up the way that I like them basically if you put in the time at the start then later on you 
[15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=913) can animate a bunch of scenes without having to model things first another way I plan ahead is by only animating what I need so you know figure out what you want to animate before starting decide 
[15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=923) where the camera should be if you have audio animate to match it if you can't see the feet in theer camera then maybe you can save time by not animating them I also animate multiple scenes at the 
[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=934) same time if I can sometimes I'll have a few scenes of my avatar just standing at the desk and I animate all of those in the same file and then separate it when I'm editing I also do all of the lip 
[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=944) syncing at the same time whether it's in a different location or not and then I can just bring that into the other scenes the idea is that you're reducing the amount of time you spend on 
[15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=953) Switching tasks people keep asking about my render settings and I just use Eevee because it's really fast so I always try to set up animations to look good and Eevee if possible you could say I end up 
[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=964) saving a lot of time by making things stylized like how I animate pose to pose and keep the transitions small it's not very realistic but I can push the exaggeration and stylize it to make it 
[16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=975) look decent and the wiggle bones add-on definitely helps me save time animating because of the extra motion it adds it can get really broken if the values aren't dialed in so it's not exactly a 
[16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=984) oneclick solution but it sure helps a lot the other obvious tip that you'll he a lot is to practice like I wouldn't have figured out any of these things if I wasn't putting time into animating 
[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=994) regularly over time you'll naturally get better and faster especially if you look at your work critically and think about what you can do better next time if you wanted this to be more about how I do 
[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=1005) things step by step then check out the videos I put in the description because I've already made a lot of them I also have a second Channel where I make more casual videos I hope all these tips help 
[16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2W5YEZVV8w&list=PLzg4_2BrWAVz4ylRx9bsfuB36MOQK2Ko0&index=4&t=1015) you out and that's it thanks for watching and have a a good one

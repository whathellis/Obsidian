(Description:: Ever find animation overwhelming? It can be useful to have a simple process to approach your work. This class explores my process for keyframing and is based on a common keyframing process in the animation industry. It might not be for everyone but I use it almost daily and have found my work has become significantly faster and easier once I started using it. )

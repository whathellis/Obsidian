Pose to Pose workflow is 1 of 3 main workflows in computer animation. Join me as I demonstrate the power of Pose to Pose Animation. This video aims to give you a solid understanding of the value of a good workflow. I use Blender for the tutorial, however Maya and any other animation software will have the same Pose to pose workflow.

If you are new to Blender have a look at my Intro to Blender video. https://youtu.be/R2RtKzrhubM

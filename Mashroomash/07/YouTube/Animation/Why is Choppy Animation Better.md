(Description:: With the release of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, we've never been closer to completely blurring the line between 2D and 3D animation. Why does "choppy" animation work so well, and why are animators so excited about it?)

Spanish Subtitles by ribbit.ram
(Disclaimer: Around 6:02, I used some ad-libbed audio, so my translated script differs from what I handed for translation and I used Google translate to fill in two lines. If they're lacking here, that would be my fault, not the translator. I believe in quality, paid translations, so thanks for understanding!)

Gimberly uses kamone416's toon shader, which you can find here:

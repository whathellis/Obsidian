(Description:: Hi! Let's understand timing charts once and for all üòÑ Timing charts are an essential tool in frame-by-frame animation, but most beginners (and even intermediates) have a hard time understanding them.)

So in this video, we'll discuss: 
1. what timing charts are
2. timing and spacing
3. how timing charts came to be
4. how to read them
5. using timing charts on various examples

This was a difficult video to make. Explaining timing charts isn't a simple task, but we hope you'll learn and enjoy watching this video.

We hope this will be the only timing chart video you'll ever need. üòÅ

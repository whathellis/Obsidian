(Description:: Last 2020, Ben invited me to this collaboration between 60 animators. The title that I chose was Self Love. In this video, I'll break down the process, and we'll go into detail about conceptualizing, designing, animating, and compositing. This is a frame by frame animation project but this isn't a step by step tutorial. This video would dive more into the thinking part behind the animation.)

[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=0) hi welcome back to our Channel and in this video I'm going to break down uh this project so I'm going to walk you through the concept phase to the design phase to the animation and finally the 
[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=14) compositing bringing all things uh together um the project files is available to our patreon supporters so if you want to join our patreon the link is in the 
[00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=25) description [Music] so first let me um let me share the background of the project so the animation is part of a collaboration 
[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=37) between 60 animators and it was organized and initiated by Ben Marriott so you probably already know about him but in case you don't I I could tell you who he is so he is an amazing motion 
[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=51) designer and he has this awesome YouTube channel uh he this is he already has like a big YouTube channel and um in his channel are tutorials that shares uh his experience tips and tricks 
[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=66) about after effects and I've watched um a handful of them and they are very helpful all of his tutorials are easy to follow so if you haven't checked out his channel right yet I recommend you to do 
[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=79) so and I will put his channel in the description as well just in case you want to check it out so around 2020 I think he messaged me on Instagram if I am interested to be part of this project 
[01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=94) in which I said um yes so the project is a collaboration between UH 60 animators so he invited 60 animators um to submit a 1.5 second animation and 
[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=109) there's a color palette that all of us should follow and there's also a theme and that theme is all about love and each animator should also submit like a title of their animation so for example 
[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=125) if you want to make an animation that showcase Your Love of cats show so the title could be cat love so it's it should be in that format blank then love so cut love if you want to make an 
[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=140) animation about pizza because you love pizza so that could be Pizza love so the title should be in that format and once all of the animators have submitted their work 
[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=153) um then Ben would piece everything together and that would be like one video so if you are interested do watch the final output I will put it somewhere on screen uh in case you want to watch 
[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=166) the final output [Music] so I decided to go with the title self-love so this was 2020 that's the start of the pandemic that's the start 
[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=179) of the lockdowns and I wasn't really feeling good about myself but I also know that I have to like love myself in order to move in order to move forward and that was the initial idea that's the 
[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=193) initial message that I want to include in my animation so when thinking about self-love another idea popped out and that idea is that there's this character and there's 
[03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=210) a mirror and there's a reflection inside that mirror and this is not an original idea I have seen a lot of posts already or maybe animation about something like this 
[03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=222) um I just don't know what that exact uh where I have found that pose but I'm very sure that this is not an original idea but what I usually see is that um the reflection is hugging the real 
[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=240) person right so the real person is very sad and then you'll see that the the the the one in reflection in in the reflection is hugging the real character or the real person and I I don't want to 
[04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=253) just copy that idea I want to make it my own and so I thought what if we had it in reverse what if the real person is hugging the reflection would that change the meaning and if so what would be the 
[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=270) new meaning be so um in the original idea that the reflection is hugging the real person um the meaning is somewhat like um comforting yourself right but if we 
[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=285) have it in reverse where the real person is hugging the one in the reflection it's more now a story about acceptance to accept your own thoughts maybe to accept your own perception of yourself 
[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=303) and that's the kind of story I want to tell so okay I think we are going in the right direction with this and from there I keep on reiterating the idea and then it became just I thought to myself that 
[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=320) what if the reflection is a monster because that's how the character perceived herself and another additional idea is what if in the process of accepting yourself the 
[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=336) one in the reflection which is first a monster begins to morph back to its human or its normal form which is the reflection of the character and then once the idea 
[05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=349) became uh that um I I had some sort of like an epiphany that this is the one this is the idea that I want uh to go with so it's easy to fall into the cool animation trap 
[06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=364) right this was a collaboration between 60 animators and surely Ben had invited other awesome animators and I just had the urge to prove myself because I know these are amazing animators and I had to 
[06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=383) keep up but um I decided to focus instead on what I had to say 
[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=392) and I focused on what's the best idea to bring that message to life and from there you just keep on iterating the idea until you are satisfied with it in the end animation is just a tool the 
[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=413) goal is to tell stories right so uh the goal is to use animation to tell that story to use animation to evoke feelings that you want to evoke in your viewers so instead instead of starting with a 
[07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=431) very cool animation instead of starting there I started with the message I started with what I want to say and this is something I need to remind myself from time to time and if this is also 
[07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=447) something you need to remind yourself from time to time so I'm reminding you now to uh don't be like don't be trapped or feel restricted about thinking about an 
[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=461) original idea or thinking about something awesome to make but instead focus on what you want to say focus on what you want to tell people what you want to 
[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=472) express [Music] so now I'm going to walk you through uh the design process I'm just I'm going to show you right now 
[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=483) so this is like my initial design so this is my initial design and I decided to use a female as a gender this is just my own personal preference I prefer drawing females and male then I decided 
[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=501) to make the eyes very big because I only have like 1.5 seconds right and um this is a very like emotional um kind of concept so uh being able to uh get the message across in terms of 
[08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=521) like the expression or feelings of the character is very important to me and since we all only have like 1.5 seconds the expression should uh be the first thing that you notice so my solution is 
[08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=536) just to make the eyes bigger but the problem with um this uh design is that if you make the eyes like big it's it almost feels like the character is a child but I 
[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=551) don't want the character to be a child I want this to be like an adult so what I did is I adjusted the proportions I made the overall proportions a bit longer and I'm already like happy 
[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=566) um with this um design and from there I created the like the mirror version uh but um in the concept phase I I told 
[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=579) you that the one in the mirror version was a monster but it doesn't really need to be literally a monster it could just be like uh we could play around with the colors of the character or the skin tone 
[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=594) could be different and in this case the eyes she doesn't have like an iris but the whole eye is is black so that could be like one way to portray that this is there's something off with this design 
[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=610) right there's like something scary about uh this design so once I am happy with um so I'm already happy with both of these so then I proceed to go with the color testing so I decided to 
[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=626) um explore the colors so this is the color palette that we could use so uh Ben didn't really like uh restricted us to use all of colors we can use as few colors as we can so uh I decided I have 
[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=644) two worlds the real world and the mirror world so I decided that this would be like the overall or I mean this is the overall color or the overall color of the background 
[10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=656) and this one would be the overall color for the background of the mirror world and for the hair color I decided to use this so that would be the hair color for both 
[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=669) the real world and the mirror world and for details I decided to use this one so these two colors would be for the real world and these two colors would be for the or 
[11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=685) I mean this two colors these two colors uh would be for the mirror world and so far it works and I decided to clean it up so now it became um like this and I'm very satisfied with uh I 
[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=702) think this now already like works so from here I decided to go into the animation phase [Music] so this is the initial animation it's 
[11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=716) nothing like the design but what I what I was trying to go for here is just to get the overall timing if I could get the point across in just 1.5 seconds so this is the one second mark this is 1.5 
[12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=731) and I'm just gonna press enter on my keyboard and that's the animation right and currently it works right the hug and um this smile uh the smile from the 
[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=743) mirror character um and then once the timing works already for me I decided to um flesh this out a bit so uh and we have two worlds right the 
[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=756) mirror world and the real world and there are like two actions here um the first one is the action of the mirror world where she would like monster up and the second action is the 
[12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=769) hugging animation which is much more difficult so I decided to start with the mirror world first so it's uh the orientation or the way it's facing is right here right 
[13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=784) um because I just thought that I'm just gonna flip this when I'm going to import this in After Effects so uh what I was thinking because there were like a mirror the character was the reflection 
[13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=798) was inside of the mirror what I decided was to use um After Effects because uh I'm not really comfortable with Adobe animate with regards to setting up like the whole project or compositing so I'm 
[13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=811) just using using Adobe animate as an frame by frame tool and I used after effects as like my main program for for animation so this is now the animations I'm just going to play this 
[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=829) and this part that the hair goes down this is now the hint that she is slowly transforming back to her original um self um and uh I didn't like include like a 
[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=845) smile right because um uh the point of like acceptance it doesn't really need to be like a smiling face right it could just be like going back to your like original 
[14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=857) um self so um that's why I decided not to have the mirror world like smile like the one in my like concept animation so now I'm going to discuss a little bit 
[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=869) about um hair animation and how it's very similar to animating other effects like fire so I have opened a new file right here and for the hair 
[14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=882) for the hair so we have like a starting hair of uh something like this and I'm not anymore going to teach you like how to animate um the shortcuts Etc this is just like 
[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=893) an overview like a breakdown of of the the project so we have other videos that I go more in depth in like how to animate but this one is basically just the thought process of how I I was able 
[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=906) to conceptualize um that project from concept to design to animation so um now I'm just going to give you an overview with the hair that it's similar 
[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=917) to um animating fire so I'm just gonna like add a blank keyframe right here I'm gonna turn on the onion skin and the way that we animate here is the same with 
[15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=928) the way we animate with fire that you think about the point so for example this is our hair right this is the like the um mirror version and the way we think 
[15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=942) about this is that there's a point right here a point right here and a point right here right and the same with uh the other side and the idea is that as the like mirror version like Powers up 
[15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=956) or monstered up um the idea is that this points are going up right and new points are being added so this one would now be here and this point would be somewhere here and 
[16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=970) this one would be like somewhere here I I I'm just gonna make this equal on the other side so that it's easier to animate but um it's better if 
[16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=981) um there is there should be like a symmetry right so if it's like it's equal left and right it feels like a natural right um but for just the sake of Simplicity 
[16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=993) I'm just doing it like this right so this is now the new frame right and as these points go up um this one in the next frame it would disappear and then we add like a new 
[16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1006) point so maybe the new point is right here and now I'm going to add a black keyframe so now at this point disappears this one would go somewhere here 
[16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1018) and this point would be here this point would be somewhere here and this one would be here you could decide if you want to add another point maybe add another Point 
[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1029) here and do you do this this is the you could just animate this into a loop you could keep on and on right so let's just I'm just going to 
[17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1040) preview this and you'll see so it's gonna look like that I'm just gonna expose this one so that it's not too fast so I'm just uh giving you like the 
[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1053) overall concept so you have now like the um the force like going up so you you could feel like the the hair is like going up like there's um a wind From 
[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1066) Below like she's powering up right and now let's go back now to the file so I'm just gonna go through this frame by frame right and you'll see uh what I meant about the points right 
[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1082) that there's like a point here like going up and then uh after the uh hug the points now would go down I'm just gonna preview this again and uh once that I'm finished with this 
[18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1101) I decided to do now the hug animation so this is now the hug animation so I normally like start with something that is easy to draw right at the beginning I don't really concern myself 
[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1118) if this is correct um what I'm trying to go for at the beginning is the action that I'm able to convey the action well so um we have like even this is just a hug 
[18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1133) this is like multiple actions um in uh into one right because uh she has to step forward to be able to reach her right so you I added a step right this step is like one action and from here 
[19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1149) you could also see that there's like a weight change so uh from the point where she drops her foot forward the weight is still here and now to reach this one we move the 
[19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1164) weight from here to here and I'm just going to preview that and then you'll see the way it changes 
[19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1174) or there's some sort of like a force transfer and once I'm good with this and also um before I forget um in the 
[19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1186) um this version right if I'm just going to preview this um it's just like that right you don't see like the head like moving forward right but when I animated the hug 
[19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1199) I need to add like the reaction right there is a reaction where after the arms are being wrapped around the neck right so there's like a reaction going on and I decided so in the end I decided to 
[20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1217) add a bit of smile to the character I'm not sure if I kept this in the final but as I made this I think it made more sense to have this like smile a bit like happy and sad uh those two emotions 
[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1232) like merging together so the next phase I'm just gonna click the new file I decided to clean this up a bit um there is still like some portions 
[20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1243) that are sketchy and then uh let's go to the like next phase so as you can see um I don't draw like very clean at the 
[20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1258) start I don't really concern myself with getting the correct drawing at the start even as I do the in-betweens um I focus on the animation I focus on 
[21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1270) the flow once I get the flow uh locked in that is the time that I um clean it up right and in frame by frame animation you go through like multiple passes so the first pass is 
[21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1284) like very sketchy and then you go back again clean it up and then you look at it and maybe you could spot some mistakes and maybe there are like some portions that you still didn't clean up 
[21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1294) because you wanted to get the motion correctly and then once you're done with the second pass you go back again at the start and then do another pass and then you can have as many passes as you go 
[21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1307) and now this is uh for this process now it's much cleaner but there are there are still a portion where it's a bit sketchy right so I just want to clean that up later on 
[22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1325) so now this is the cleanup and I have added like color to this and the way I colored this one is just uh it's just simple I'm just using a brush and a fill so the brush so um the shortcut is B on 
[22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1343) my keyboard and you know you just make sure you close it and then fill the shortcut is K and then like that that's just how I colored this right so um so I is the eyedropper tool so I'm 
[22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1356) just gonna like pick that color like for example the arms I just like uh make an arm like this and then press K and then uh that's now with color but of course um I made it like more clean here so 
[22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1370) this and I also have like different like layers right for example the arm uh this is in one layer and I also have the dress in a different layer and also here I'm just gonna scrub 
[23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1384) through on the timeline and you'll see here that I have like multiple images this is um this is the smear right uh if you are like 
[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1397) um using a camera like for example with this camera that you're watching right now and I'm like waving my head right if you uh if that's like very quick if you pause that video you'll see that there's 
[23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1408) going to be like multiple images because the camera can't capture all of my movement right it's also I want to capture that same effect in my animation so I added some like Double Image on 
[23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1423) like a few frames where it's fast right when so like when she like hugs um there's that like fast motion uh that's the point where you could add like smear to your animation and then 
[23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1436) finally I decided to um color the uh the mirror version and this is now uh the result so as you can see here um you'll see that I use the human color 
[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1452) for uh the skin tone um but in the design phase I decided to make the skin tone green um that's because um I decided to I don't want and I also 
[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1464) don't know how how to animate the color in Adobe animate so I'm more comfortable with using Adobe animate as a frame by frame tool but it's easier for me to um 
[24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1478) to wrap around the idea of changing colors in After Effects so what I've decided is just to import um these layers in After Effects and apply a fill effect and then I'm going 
[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1491) to animate The Fill effect from one color to another color or um or I think you could use color change effect in Adobe After Effects so that's the reason why I decided to 
[25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1505) use this color and also for her dress it's it's the normal color it's not the mirror version color because I I'm I was just thinking I'm going to use like Alpha mattes for this uh for the change 
[25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1520) of color um or I mean I'm going to animate like an effects and I'm going to Alpha matte that to the address foreign 
[25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1534) [Music] for our overall animation um well not everything but uh we have like the major ones we have finished the mirror animation we have finished the 
[25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1551) hug animation so we could now like bring um bring them together and maybe just add like the backgrounds and other like assets that we need that maybe the mirror maybe I'm just gonna make that uh 
[26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1563) in in After Effects so the first thing that you would want is how do we import like the the one that we made in Adobe animate into Adobe After Effects so the the normal way is just to 
[26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1579) um to create an swf file and then import the SWA file in After Effects and to do that um the shortcut is command enter if you're working in uh in a Mac computer 
[26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1592) that's control enter if you're working in a Windows computer and that's going to automatically create an swf file so in our After Effects project go to file go to import import file and then locate 
[26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1607) the swf so that is this one zero six swf then click open and then you have this so I'm just going to create a new comp um that will do I'm just going to click OK and then I'm just going to drag this 
[27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1621) in my comp and then we have like the animations I'm just going to zoom in the timeline right and now we have the the animation but this is just one layer right so how 
[27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1632) do we like bring like all of the layers to my After Effects project so there is a way to include um all of the layers here inside of After Effects but 
[27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1646) um there's a little bit of uh difference in terms of process right we're not going to import the swf we are going to import the dot fla the project file for uh the Adobe animate file so but before 
[27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1661) you import the dot fla or flaw um make sure that here on the properties and on the dock and if you go to document settings uh click the s'more settings make sure that you have used 
[27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1677) the advanced layers because if this is unchecked it's not going to work so make sure that this is checked so that's checked I'm going to click OK and then now let's try so the file name of this 
[28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1688) is zero six this is like step six in my process so now for example I'm going to click file import then file then locate the dot dot fla file that's 
[28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1701) going to be this06.fla and then I'm going to click open so uh after a while it's going to prompt this one um this would only tell you like uh 
[28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1712) because what it will do is it will create a DOT swf for all of your layers and after effects wants to know where do you want to save these files so um currently uh I'm already good with this 
[28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1730) just save it on the animation slash character folder okay okay and then now we have this so I'm just going to double click this comp and now we have this 
[29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1742) um my only problem with this one is that um there is no way to make um the bounding box um in like the same size as the drawing so for example this one and also it's 
[29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1757) going to include like the guide layers so right now this is like empty like every empty layer in um Adobe animate would also be imported so make sure you clean it up uh first so 
[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1771) um and the files I the layer name here is I didn't did a good job at layering the one the the one that only slayered is the hair so yeah uh good job past Mar so don't do 
[29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1785) that okay um so when you like make an animation make sure that these are layered so that when you import it in After Effects um 
[29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1795) it's organized and it's easier to locate uh your layers right so right now the the only thing that's easy to locate is the hair right so but now you could see it's it has um different layers which is 
[30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1808) what we want so this one is for the head and this one is for the arms so for the arms um so I'm just gonna like demonstrate 
[30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1820) um how I'm going to change the color of this right so this is the arm and we and if I'm gonna zoom in we have this detailed right so I can't 
[30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1829) really use the fill effects I'm just gonna type here fill and let's uh apply this to that layer because I'm gonna lose that detail right or unless if I have 
[30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1841) um created the uh another a different layer for like the details I mean the fill effect could work but there's also a different effect that could like work on this and that is change to color so 
[30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1856) I'm just going to type here change to color and I'm going to double click this apply it to this layer and now it has applied to that layer so here you could see 
[31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1867) um how you would want this uh there's this like from and two so I'm just gonna like click this eyedropper tool and then click this color so from that color I'm going to change 
[31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1880) it to um there's a specific hex code for that but um just for a quick demonstration I'm just gonna uh maybe make it um like this 
[31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1889) I think it was like The Scholar and then click OK as you can see it changed color but the change is only for the U right so if I'm gonna expand this what you want is for all of the aspect 
[31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1905) of the color the use uh the U lightness and desaturation so I'm gonna click this one and now uh that is uh the change that's being made so how I'm going to change 
[31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1917) um the color of this is I'm going to change the color of the two right here right so I'm just gonna like move forward in time because it's gonna change the color at around maybe at this 
[32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1930) point in time so I'm just gonna click this one now so I'm gonna press U on my keyboard to reveal the keyframes so now I have this keyframe now I'm gonna move to the start 
[32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1941) and then since this Earth is already like keyframed right and I'm just going to click this eyedropper tool and I'm gonna make it to be the same as this one and now the color 
[32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1953) has changed so I'm just going to zoom out and I'm just going to preview this and then here at the end right it's gonna change back to the original colors 
[32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1967) I'm gonna like create a keyframe here and then at this point in time I'm just gonna copy this keyframe because this is the abnormal or the human color so it's going to be um like that or uh 
[33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1983) I'm just gonna bring this uh or it it doesn't need to be like full I don't think I made this to full human color but just around here so you could just extend this like forward even more 
[33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=1999) right so so it just like Acts or like at the beginning of the animation of the color and just do the same process for uh the head and also like uh the legs so let me 
[33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2015) do that so now I did the same process for the head and the legs and this is the result now how about the dress right it changes um it changes the the color and we have 
[33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2030) that like effects right when uh the the change of of the color of the dress so now let's go back to Adobe animate and I have made uh this effect this red one right I'm just gonna press enter on 
[34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2045) my keyboard and let me just uh preview this because we just need this animation not the all of the layers so I could just like import the swf file so I'm just gonna uh 
[34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2060) click command enter uh that's Ctrl enter if you're working on a Windows computer so now we have this and now I'm just gonna import the uh this swf file and now we're back in After Effects I'm 
[34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2076) gonna go file import and import file and then locate the swf this is the swf and I'm gonna click open and now I need to locate the dress and um too bad I did not 
[34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2090) um this was like a few years ago and uh now it's very confusing during the time that I did this it wasn't as confusing because I was like in the zone but that 
[35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2102) is a disadvantage if you don't layer your or you don't name your layers because if you go back to it years after it's very hard to because somehow you already forgot about uh this project 
[35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2118) right so I'm just gonna locate this real quick so this is now the bottom part of the dress I'm just gonna rename this right bottom dress so this is the the upper address I'm 
[35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2131) just going to rename this and now uh we have this swf file right so I'm just gonna bring this on top of the bottom dress and let's see the animation 
[35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2145) um something like that right uh and um but I want it doesn't take form of the dress right so we're gonna use um Alpha mats right so I'm already on my like track matte mode here if you don't 
[36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2161) see this you need to click the toggle switches mode and uh now I have seen this there's this quick uh pick whip so I'm just gonna pick with this to the bottom dress so 
[36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2174) now it's like that it has hidden the bottom part so let me reveal this right and what it does is now it's like that right and if I want to change the color I just need to change the color 
[36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2188) um of the animation uh this one right this is the the animation um and now I could use the feel effect right so I'm just gonna type here and uh type fill and apply this effect to that 
[36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2202) layer and then for the fill now I could also animate the color if I want but I think the color is this the same with the hair so now it's going to be um like that and 
[36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2215) then I'm just gonna uh duplicate this because we need to do that to do the same process for the upper dress so I'm gonna duplicate this and maybe bring this above the upper 
[37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2226) dress layer um but in currently the mask or the track matte is still linked to the bottom dress I'm just gonna link this to the upper dress now 
[37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2237) and when you do that it would automatically hide the upper dress just reveal that one and now we have this so that's uh basically the concept of 
[37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2252) how um I changed the color and how I was able to play around um with like the masking of like the animation so uh this is now the final uh 
[37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2264) file so um this is the the file that I did years ago and I decided to change the color of the dress to Yellow because currently it 
[37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2278) feels kind of dull it's so like gray so we need like a break uh a break on or to add a bit of variety to add visual interest to the whole image so I made the dress yellow so that it's more like 
[38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2294) eye-catching and this is the animation and um this one here the mirror version so it is Alpha matte to this mirror and for the background I just created that in 
[38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2311) Adobe animate but the mirror itself was done in After Effects using shape layers so why is it that it's just like preference um it would be better if you used like 
[38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2324) one software for the background but for here I just uh made this to like what made sense during the time like what is the quickest way because anyway I'm just the only one animating it right uh 
[38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2338) there's like I didn't need to pass the animation to someone else so I I have a bit of Freedom like what I could do but there are certainly like best practices especially if you're working in a team 
[39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2352) but this one I'm just working solo here this is just like a personal product project right even though if this is like a collaboration but the one that I'm going to submit is just the uh the 
[39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2364) video file right um but the the files in here I'm the only one who's going to to animate that I'm the only one that's going to work on it so I could do whatever I want so this 
[39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2376) mirror here that's a shape layer the background is done in Adobe animate and let me show you so the background is basically just uh this one right since I decided to uh to draw the mirror in 
[39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2390) Adobe After Effects so I decided to make this blank right and uh it's just even just one frame so I'm just gonna like command enter so we have this swf and I'm just going to import the swf file in 
[40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2405) Adobe After Effects so we have a a problem that we need uh to solve so I created I just recently just just now I created a new comp renamed it to sample just to illustrate 
[40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2422) um the problem so the problem is this right this is the mirror version and if I'm uh it it's a comp right the way we imported it is using the advanced layer but for the hug animation since I don't 
[40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2435) really need to change the color I decided to use the swf method in importing it so that because I don't really need different layers for this but we have a problem 
[40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2447) um this is the problem so it's not really correct when it um hugs right so we need to uh maybe bring this on top so that uh maybe that would be the correct one 
[41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2461) but it's still not the correct one right it's correct on some aspects but the head isn't correct actually we need the head to be below the um below the mirror version but we need 
[41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2475) the body and this part of the arm to be above but we need this part of the arm to be uh below so um how do we solve that 
[41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2492) so this is the arm as you can see this is the arm only and I place that on top and also for the body I also have like I duplicated like the comp and you know masked it out 
[41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2511) and I have the head uh below the shadow I mean below the mirror character so this part right so uh this are my parts right this is um the one below 
[42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2525) I have this and I also and I also have this part and also this part right so that I would now have like the correct like layering and also for the mirror world I like animated this 
[42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2541) swirl in the mirror itself so it's uh it's this file this is the um swirl uh like I I animated a separate file for this and then I just 
[42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2559) um Alpha matte it to the mirror so now it's uh this is the the result and also I animated this like um uh this effect 
[42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2574) like uh when she hugs this it's like the Black Mirror world is like disappearing and like going back to its um original colors and uh this is the the result 
[43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2588) oh and also I added like a cast Shadow for this character so what I did is I just duplicated uh the hug animation so this one I duplicated that I'm just going to demonstrate this and then I 
[43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2604) used a cc slant and then bring the floor this one I'm gonna click this and set the floor around here and then for the height I'm just gonna bring this to negative and 
[43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2619) then the slant and then uh because we need this to be in just one solid color and then I added a fill effect to this and then change the color to whatever color that you want or the shadow color 
[43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2634) so I'm just gonna delete this now that's how I did on this cash shadow and that's the result of the animation [Applause] [Music] 
[44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2650) uh that's it uh if you reach at this point thank you very much for your time thank you very much for watching the video for the watching the full video uh and I hope you found this uh insightful 
[44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2663) I hope you were able to get a glimpse into my thought process um because um getting skills or acquiring skills is important 
[44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2674) um knowing the techniques and building the techniques and skills in After Effects in Adobe animate and knowing how to animate I mean these are important but what's more important is knowing how 
[44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2686) to use those skills in your animation or knowing how to use those skills to tell your story and I hope with this video it is able to help you um get a glimpse into like how I think 
[45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Etlsynhi0&t=2703) and how I used those um techniques in a telling a story and the pr if you're interested to download the project files it's offered to our patreon supporters and if you are

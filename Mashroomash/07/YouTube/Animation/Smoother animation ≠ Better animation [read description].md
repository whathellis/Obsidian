Correction:
0:06 This entire video is outdated

(Description:: I made this video when 'AI' was little more than a buzzword. I tackled interpolated slop from the angle of an animator, because I hadn't seen anyone else speaking constructively about the technology's shortcomings, or correct/incorrect use cases. It was a niche thing that annoyed me. )

Three years later, AI is a massive cultural issue. It has been created unethically, it is extremely environmentally harmful, and it is replacing talented people with rent to pay. The conversation should no longer be about how AI generated content sucks, because these observations are no longer constructive or helpful. There are philosophical, practical, and moral issues that need to be addressed, and I don't think there's a worse way to look them than through the lens of pretty/ugly.

Maybe I'll make a video about this one day, but for now, I chose to focus on what AI generated slop has taught me about the way I view art. For me, art is a means of connecting with and understanding other human beings. By removing the human element from art, it loses all meaning to me. Because it's no longer a given that anything I see was made by a person, I've come to appreciate the real people who make things now more than ever. 

Hope this made sense. Thanks for reading.

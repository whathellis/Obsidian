Straight Ahead workflow is 1 of 3 main workflows in computer animation. Join me as I demonstrate the power of Straight Ahead Animation. This video aims to give you a solid understanding of the value of a good workflow. I use Blender for the tutorial, however Maya and any other animation software will have the same Straight ahead workflow. Speed of blocking is the true power of this workflow.

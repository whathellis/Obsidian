[00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=11) hey I need I need to talk about [Music] cartoons I think we all take for granted just how easy it is to make stuff these 
[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=28) days I'd consider myself an amateur animator at this [Music] point the first animated thing I ever made was in this video from a while back 
[00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=42) and even though it might look complicated that's just because of the fancy compositing the animation itself was pretty simplistic all things considered the goal here was to come up 
[00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=54) with a unique looking 2D 3D hybrid style I absolutely love traditional animation but I'm not nearly patient enough to do it myself which is why I'm actually completely 
[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=66) 3D you're looking at a screen grab of the animation viewport in blender right now and this is what it looks like rendered the blue lines are to differentiate the characters outline 
[01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=76) from the background and the red skin and green shirt are so we can create separate masks for the two different textures of paper then we just motion track the face so that way the paper 
[01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=85) moves naturally with the movements of the character Sam was the one who figured all that stuff out he's my VFX guy I pretty much just stick to blender hey s oh oh that was unlocked yeah all 
[01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=97) right well did my explanation cover everything yep so when I say something like animation has never been easier am I saying that any of this was easy but what I am saying is that it was 
[01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=115) accessible blender and da Vinci resolve both cost a combined total of0 resolve has a paid license for 300 that'll get you some fancy features which admittedly we did pay for but all 
[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=125) of the effects demonstrated here are available in the free version the fact that a couple of amateurs can watch some tutorials on YouTube and figure all this stuff out without paying a dime is 
[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=135) insanely cool the tools to create pretty much whatever you want have never been more readily available which is why we've seen such a Renaissance of independent animation in recent years 
[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=144) but it didn't used to be this way he just going back 10 years ago in blender's 2D animation tools were still in their infancy going back 20 years dingi resolve doesn't even exist and 
[02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=155) blender 2.3 is basically unrecognizable from what it is now you could still make some pretty impressive stuff with it especially for the year 2004 but it was far from intuitive and if you know 
[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=166) anything about blender that's dang a lot going back 30 years to 1994 and the production of the original Toy Story is near incompletion for being the first featurelength 3D animated film it holds 
[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=178) up surprisingly well me no most of the time at least but the visuals aren't the part I find the most impressive it's the fact that this movie even exists in the first place back in the ' 80s and '90s 
[03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=192) Pixar was most well known for their animated shorts such as Luxo Jr which you probably recognize knickknack which was remastered in 2003 to be a little bit 
[03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=202) less a little bit less or tin toy the one with the most terrifying Baby that had has ever existed surprisingly they didn't actually get their start as an animation studio even though it was 
[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=215) always their goal to become one in fact these shorts mostly existed as a tech demo to show off the Pixar image computer which was designed with purpose built hardware for displaying 3D 
[03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=225) Graphics before they made movies they made computers really really expensive computers if you've ever wondered why Steve Jobs had anything to do with Pixar 
[03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=237) now you know the production of toy St story would have never been possible were it not for the animation tools that Pixar's Engineers built from the ground up Hardware included and it all started 
[04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=247) with one Ed catmull you might know him as the now retired president of Disney Animation where previously he served as the president and co-founder of Pixar and if you know anything about me you 
[04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=258) might know that I'm not a fan of giant publicly traded Mega corporations I think they're uh very bad actually we'll touch on his business philosophies later don't you worry but before he sat in an 
[04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=270) executive seat catl was a software engineer with a focus on computer visuals something which at the time he studied it didn't really exist a few years after receiving his PhD in 
[04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=280) Computer Sciences catl drew the attention of George Lucas who brought him on to work as the head of the newly founded Lucas film computer division called the graphics group it was staffed 
[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=290) with the best and brightest in the science of making a computer show you an image that 1979 had to offer and while the original Star Wars featured a teeny tiny bit of computerated 
[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=301) visuals destroy St there it is Lucas realized that CGI wouldn't really be necessary for its sequel instead he had cill and his team focus on developing what would eventually be called edit 
[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=314) Droid one of the first pieces of digital video editing software ever prior to nonlinear editing on a computer film reels were physically edited by cutting and pasting strips into the finished 
[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=325) product the ability to do this all digitally was probably a pretty big deal and while edit Droid was undeniably groundbreaking it isn't what I want to focus on here and not coincidentally 
[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=336) catmull and the rest of the graphics group felt exactly the same way everyone in the lab was in awe of Star Wars one weekend in the summer of 1977 during one of their excursions to Manhattan the 
[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=347) group took in a matina of the film it amazed them so much they saw it again that same day they assumed they could only dream of getting a call from Lucas film to their frustration although Lucas 
[05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=358) now had on his payroll perhaps the world's top technical talent in 3D animation he wasn't asking the group to do any his special effects group at industrial Light and Magic saw no use 
[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=368) for computer Graphics either boy the irony of industrial Light and Magic who are today the most ubiquit visual effect studio in Hollywood seeing no use for computer Graphics is kind of hilarious 
[06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=382) indeed from the standpoint of computer Graphics Lucas's Second Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back was a step backward from the first it included no computer Graphics at all it became 
[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=392) pretty clear fairly early on that there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm that we thought there would be inside Lucas film for computer Graphics where it was extensively utilized was in Star Trek 2 
[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=402) the Wrath of con Paramount Pictures commissioned the lucasfilm's graphics group to create this one minute sequence which required months of work with contributions from some of the era's 
[06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=412) greatest Minds in CGI matter is reorganized with life this might look pretty primitive by today's standards but in 1982 audiences were blown away but I want to go back even 
[07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=424) earlier to a 1976 sci-fi thriller called future world I won't go into the story too much here but its main plot centers around a fictional Mega Corporation creating artificial humans for 
[07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=434) entertainment and a sequence in a control room full of computers features this little animation on most of its screens it was created by Ed catmull and his classmate Fred Park in 1972 as part 
[07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=445) of their postgraduate course in computer science and it is widely considered to be the first piece of computer generated 3D animation ever it's kind of astonishing 
[07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=456) to think that in less than 10 years we went from this to this I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the research paper that 
[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=468) spawned this little video kind of changed everything computer animation was sort of on The Lunatic Fringe at that time Said Fred Park a fellow PhD student in cat class who also worked on 
[08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=480) animation people were just barely to the point where they could get a computer to put out still images it was obvious that it would take years for the state-of-the-art in computer hardware to 
[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=489) catch up with this ambition and there was no end of problems to be solved on the mathematical and programming side nonetheless from kill's point of view there was no better time or place to get 
[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=498) started than right here and now in 1972 3D modeling software obviously didn't exist so in order to create the 3D model a mold of Ed's hand was cast of plaster the surface of it was coated in latex 
[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=511) and 350 polygons were meticulously drawn onto it if this thing still existed it would be in a museum but according to catell unfortunately um the hand hasn't survived part of it was because over 
[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=525) time latex turns into a goo although I I wish I had actually clean cleaned it off and kept the hand every single point of every polygon had to be mapped out before it could be rendered in 3D this 
[08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=537) machine that Ed is using in the video was a mechanical digitizer which provided a readout of each X Y and Z coordinate as three distinct numbers which were captured with a mouse or 
[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=548) Mouse for some perspective according to kill's research paper this entire hand was covered in 350 total polygons and each polygon had three vertices minimum four Max there ended up being 270 
[09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=560) intersecting Corners times three coordinates that's 810 data points to keep track of for those unfamiliar with 3D modeling terms I'll use the default Cube Tu and blender as a reference this 
[09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=571) point here is a vertex it's where two edges which are the lines that make up a polygon intersect a polygon is a flat surface composed of edges and vertices that join together so the face of this 
[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=581) cube is a polygon made of four edges and four vertices a four-sided polygon is usually called a quad with a three-sided polygon called a tri this hand was made of 350 polygons in total so not only did 
[09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=595) they have to graph out every single point on this model they had to man ually measure the X Y and Z coordinates of every single vertex of every single polygon with everything in this process 
[10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=607) being as manual as it was it should come as no surprise that rendering the animation into something you could actually watch was manual as well when I'm done with the video I go to the 
[10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=616) render page in Da Vinci resolve uh then I hit the render button and and then it um and then it renders it but digital video codex didn't exist in 1972 remember this is back when 
[10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=629) computers were barely able to display a single static image let alone real-time playback on a video file just getting a look at his imagery was a task in itself because the display Hardware never 
[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=639) showed the entire image on screen at any one moment it took 30 seconds or so to cycle through the image cill could see a frame of his work only by taking a long exposure Polaroid of the screen and 
[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=650) looking at the snapshot once he was satisfied he then shot the footage using a 35mm movie camera that the department had rigged to take pictures of a CRT screen 
[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=660) this passage makes it sound easier than it actually was I've been digging around through research papers to try and find exactly how this photography rig was set up and they all gloss over that 
[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=670) particular detail but to put it into perspective each frame of this animation took about 30 seconds to display on the computer screen because the computer only had enough memory to show a sliver 
[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=679) of it this means that in order to see a single frame of Animation a rolling slice of the image was slowly displayed over the course of 30 seconds and a long exposure photo was required to see the 
[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=691) entire frame all at once they couldn't just hit play and turn the camera on to record it they had to wait for every frame to be fully exposed before they could move on to the next one I think 
[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=702) it's a bit of an understatement to say that this experiment was ahead of its time these days it seems like the second a new piece of technology shows up every Fortune 500 company drops everything and 
[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=713) restructures their entire business around it the metaverse nfts and cryptocurrency AI generated text and imagery who knows what's 
[12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=728) next my money is on artisanal bread making but back in the 1970s computer Graphics were seen as more of a neat little experiment than anything 
[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=743) revolutionary they were very disparaging about it how what they were doing was wildly impractical and didn't have anything to do with real world or whatever I thought it was 
[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=751) great because I knew that we were offing something really big and and somehow these people were were missing it in fact in computer science departments Across the Nation computer Graphics was 
[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=762) not considered a legitimate area of research it was an application was off to the side that the graphics wasn't legitimate they couldn't imagine what would happen when we were producing so 
[12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=772) much data that we needed other ways of being able to to see and understand what they were working with eventually after receiving funding from Steve Jobs Ed catmull and his co-worker Alvi Ray Smith 
[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=783) would co-found Pixar breaking away from lucas films and focusing on Independent animation work Alvi Ray Smith would then go on to be royally screwed over by Steve Jobs and kicked out of the company 
[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=792) but that's another story for another time cat's goal from the very beginning even in 1972 was to use computers to create movies and I don't think Pixar gets nearly enough credit for being able 
[13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=803) to do what they did yes they are credited as the studio that made the first fully CGI feature length film but the steps they had to take to get to that point don't get talked about nearly 
[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=813) enough 3D animation as it is now can largely be traced back to the pioneering advances made by a small handful of people and most of them worked with Ed catl at some point or another sure 
[13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=823) blender can be intimidating at first but you can only learn how to use a tool if that tool exists and in 1991 when Toy Story was officially greenlet by Disney most of them didn't a lot of the 
[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=836) characters you see throughout the film were hands sculpted into giant clay busts and digitized with a probe using a much more advanced version of the same process that catl used to create the 
[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=845) model of his hand 3D modeling has never been easier with all the technology we have access to now I could do all of that on my iPad Nomad sculpt is only 15 bucks which is still insane to me 
[14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=858) considering everything it can do it's the only digital sculpting tool I've ever seen where you can just kind of pick it up and start using it you don't need to take a course just to navigate 
[14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=867) through its menus if you tried learning blender or zbrush but couldn't figure out it sculpting tool set this is definitely your next best bet if you have an iPad or an 
[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=876) Android tablet at that price there's really no reason not to pick it up even if you're just curious about making art I'm not sponsored by them I promise I just I just really like this program 
[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=885) making the model itself was a pretty simple process but it was sculpted with Dynamic topology you don't need to know what that means all that matters is that if we look at the mesh it is not 
[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=893) animation ready that's where the process called retopology comes in what I'm doing here is essentially recreating the model with a cleaner grid of polygons by drawing them on top of the original one 
[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=904) which is also in an app on my iPad called cozy blanket retopology is normally an obnoxious timec consuming process but look at how easy this is comparing that to physically probing 
[15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=914) every polygon manually and it's actually kind of relaxing and in just a couple hours of work I've got myself a little Woody anyway kml's contributions to computer Imaging are still being used to 
[15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=930) this day by me right now on his Wikipedia page under the known for Section it lists the algorithms he helped to develop and it doesn't even mention his time spent as 
[15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=940) company president and I got to say it's pretty refreshing to see somebody in an engineering position who actually understands the industry because he kind of helped build it put into an executive 
[15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=950) position instead of some callous un feeling businessman what's that Pixar animators despite being widely regarded as the best in the industry were typically paid 
[16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=961) less than their contemporaries at other Studios and Not only was this well known within the company but there was collusion with lucasfilm to ensure that employees wouldn't be recruited away 
[16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=970) from Pixar or vice versa and that both companies were artificially limiting their salaries and additionally as president of Pixar catl ballooned this agreement 
[16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=980) into a cartel of other Animation Studios as well as Silicon Valley businesses such as Apple and Google that fixed employee wages something which is not only anti competitive and illegal but 
[16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=990) when questioned about it he callously refused to apologize for I should stop repeating everything you say verbatim and suddenly receiving information via phone call in a heavily 
[16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1000) scripted medium is an overused Trope and that acknowledging the Trope doesn't actually make it funny okay yeah I love you too bye-bye to quote the Bloomberg article 
[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1013) that broke this story catmull said he saw it as his duty to insulate Northern California film companies from salary bidding wars that drive costs up move the animation jobs overseas and destroy 
[17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1024) the US industry like somehow we're hurting some employees we're not cill said while I have the responsibility for the payroll I have the responsibility for the long-term also I don't apologize 
[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1035) for this and while I can understand his position San Francisco is pretty famously one of the most expensive places to live and Pixar kept breaking box office record after record 
[17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1049) but Playing devil's advocate here he does actually raise a decent Point Pixar to this day doesn't Outsource any of their animation to lower wage countries anything that could possibly be done 
[17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1061) inhouse is something that cannot be said for basically any other production company so they have to be doing something right and who knows as a studio operating under Disney it 
[17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1072) wouldn't surprise me if their Executives were trying to cut salaries to decrease budgets Pixar's number one operating expense is wage after all that's the main reason their movies are so 
[18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1081) expensive now obviously this is a pretty complicated issue that goes beyond the scope of this video so I'm dramatically simplifying things but I kind of feel like and this might be a controversial 
[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1091) opinion here but the people who actually make the movies should probably be appropriately compensated for making the movies I'm looking at you DreamWorks 
[18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1105) whether you enjoy their more recent output or not and if you say anything bad about Luca I will make fun of you Pixar well and truly pioneered 3D animation as a medium something that the 
[18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1115) entire world gets to benefit from outside of entertainment and it all started with a handful of brilliant Engineers who just wanted to make movies if you liked this video I'd love 
[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1128) to turn it into a series of sorts the history of 3D animation is pretty fascinating and one that I don't think gets nearly enough recognition I've seen a handful of videos talking about 
[18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1137) animation itself but hardly any going into the people who made it or how it was actually made if that's something you want to see please let me know in the comments this isn't shallow 
[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebllmoLIf4&list=WL&index=8&t=1146) engagement bait I legitimately just want to know what people want to see out of this channel uh if you enjoyed this you'll probably like our video on the newspaper comic turned web coma Keith

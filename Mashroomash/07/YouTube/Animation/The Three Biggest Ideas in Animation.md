(Description:: Welcome to Animation for Anyone. In our second class I'll explain the three biggest ideas in Animation and how they can help you use all the other principles more easily. Hope you enjoy!)

Also a small correction, I incorrectly named the producer of the example film Lost and Found as Lucy Haynes when in fact her name is Lucy Hayes. Apologies about that, and thanks again to the team for letting me share their work here. 
 
A note on software:
We don't touch on software in this class because I believe there are already lots of great tutorials out there but if you're interested in low cost options to get started there are a few that come to mind- Blender is a free 3D package and includes a "Grease Pencil" mode if you're interested in learning 2D animation. Procreate on IOS is inexpensive and has new animation features (simply turn on Animation Assist in the canvas menu). Adobe Creative Cloud suite is certainly not "low cost" but some of you may have access to it for other uses. If that is the case Photoshop and Animate CC both offer powerful animation tools and will be included in your Creative Cloud Membership. I have an in depth, but quite old tutorial for using Photoshop as animation tool here https://vimeo.com/80851591

Description:: Welcome to Blender Animation! This tutorial marks the second installment in my comprehensive series on animating in Blender. In my previous video, we delved into the fundamentals of scene setup, hotkey adjustments, and the essential 12 principles of Animation. In this tutorial, we will explore two additional principles: Anticipation and Posing.

To fully participate, make sure to download the Blender Ball Rig, provided to you free of charge. Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments you may have. And if you've created your own bouncing ball animation, I would be thrilled to see it!

If you find value in my videos, please take a moment to like and comment. Your feedback is invaluable in helping me gauge what is effective and what needs improvement.

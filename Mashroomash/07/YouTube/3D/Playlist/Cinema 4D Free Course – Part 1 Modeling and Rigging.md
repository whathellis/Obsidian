[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=0) let's start with simple blocking this shape is very simple so we're going to use standard Primitives so click and hold on a cube and select cylinder now you should see it in a viewport and 
[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=14) object manager so select it and in object tab switch the orientation to plus X and then we're going to adjust the height and radius to make the proportions look similar to the 
[00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=28) reference image next we gonna create a sphere and adjust the proportions to make the eye I'm just using move scale and rotate tools you can find it here on the sidebar 
[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=44) but I suggest you to use shortcuts w e and r if you want to duplicate an object in viewport just hold down Ctrl or command on Mac then click and drag using move tool 
[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=59) now let's select the cylinder then hold down Ctrl command on Mac and duplicate it in object manager I'm gonna adjust the proportions to make a wooden tube something like this 
[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=74) now I want to isolate it in viewport and just select an object and use viewport solo in attributes set High segments to 1 and I want to get rid of caps 
[01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=87) just to make it a hollow tube like this now right click on the cylinder and make it editable you can use shortcut C now this is polygonal object and we can manipulate points and polygons so let's 
[01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=100) switch to point mode and use a rectangle selection to select these points and move it aside a little along x-axis using move tool since we're gonna animate on static 
[01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=114) camera let's create a camera straight away it will help us to avoid unnecessary modeling since we're going to use redshift for render let's go to render settings and switch renderer to 
[02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=125) redshift you may have noticed that the camera icon has changed Now by default this is redshift camera but first I'll adjust the view angle and 
[02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=137) then click on the camera icon to create a camera you should see it in object manager and in viewports click on this little square icon and your active viewport will use 
[02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=148) this camera let's take a look on a reference once again and you can see there are almost no perspective Distortion it looks more orthogonal so we're gonna adjust camera 
[02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=162) attributes a little bit let's select the camera and I'm gonna adjust focal length and next I'll move it out a bit and slightly adjust the angle if you're happy with the camera and you 
[02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=175) want to protect it from The Accidental movement select the camera and create a protection tag now I cannot move the camera in this viewport and it will be convenient to use another viewport for 
[03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=187) navigation I'll just switch this viewport to perspective and further I will use it to navigate a scene let's add a little more details select the body cylinder then in 
[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=203) attributes manager in object tab increase the amount of rotation segments and height segments the density of the polygons should be something like this then in caps tab I want to add a little 
[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=215) fillet to smooth out the edges and also increase segments a little bit next let's make this object editable I'm going to recreate these bombs around the tube for this we're gonna use 
[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=235) sculpting tools let's isolate it using viewport solo and in point mode Let's select this point when you activate the move tool in attributes manager you can find soft selection tab let's enable it 
[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=250) just click on the checkbox I'll switch follow-up type to needle and if you move the point it will drag other points along I just want to dip it inside a bit now switch to edges mode double click on 
[04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=263) the edge to select Edge Loop this time I'll switch to bell curve and then move it back a little the overall shape now is a little closer to the reference 
[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=276) next let's go to the mesh menu find brushes and click on this little Dash this will allow to keep the menu on top now select the cylinder and in this menu you can find different brushes for 
[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=291) instance you can grab points using grab brush or you can use inflate names are pretty self-explanatory try to experiment with these brushes but now I mostly will use inflate brush nothing 
[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=304) complicated here I'll just add a little volume you can quickly change the radius by holding down third Mouse button and dragging it horizontally 
[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=320) if you want to get rid of sharp edges between polygons select the funk tag and turn off and limit this workplane interferes with the model 
[05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=331) a bit you can turn it off in filter menu also you can smooth it a bit using smooth brush you can use knife brush to add a little contrast between the bumps just a little 
[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=355) bit now I'll speed up the video I will use the same brushes I will sculpt and smooth the overall shape to make it look less geometric and more like a 
[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=372) marshmallow I'm not going to sculpt the other side because we'll never see it from the camera let's take a look what we got for now 
[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=390) let's look at from the camera and turn off the solo mode I like the shape and topology in general so we can close the brushes menu we don't need it anymore 
[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=402) and next let's adjust the shape of the tube switch to edges mode double click on the edge to select an edge loop I also want to disable soft 
[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=413) selection and activate scale tool hold down Ctrl command on Mac and scale it down a bit this way you can extrude it inwards next I'm going to select move tool hold 
[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=428) down Ctrl command on Mac and move it inside along x-axis to see modeling tools menu right click on the viewport and select Loop path cut using this tool you can add edge Loops 
[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=441) just click on an edge like this to create an edge Loop now switch to polygon mode to work with polygons then go to select menu and find Loop selection and select this polygon loop 
[07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=454) around the tube activate scale tool hold down control command on Mac and scale it outwards like this now switch to edges mode double click on 
[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=466) edge to select an edge Loop and adjust its position I want to see how it looks subdivided so I'll select the tube hold down alt and create subdivision surface it should 
[07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=478) appear as a parent of the cylinder now let's see how it looks looks quite good and we don't need it for now so I'll undo the subdivision surface 
[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=491) we have more and more objects so let's rename everything to make life easier I'll rename camera to Main I also rename spheres to Li and RI respectively and cylinders will become 
[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=506) body and stick for eyelids I will use Taurus primitive you can find it in the same menu next I'll use transformation tools to place it properly 
[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=523) and adjust radii hold down Ctrl command on Mac then click and drag to duplicate it in this scene we have very simple models and the main difficulty will be to use 
[09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=552) non-standard methods for modeling and animation and we need to take it into account during modeling for instance in order to model the mouth we need to look at the reference and find out the poses 
[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=564) it will take you can see that the mouth will be deformed much in different frames in this case the best option is to use spline in this way we will be able to 
[09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=575) deform the shape of the mouth change the radius of the leaves and constrain teeth and it will be much easier to animate spline than polygonal object let's switch to front view and create a 
[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=589) rectangle spline it is too big for now so I'll scale it down and move it forward a bit to be able to adjust points of the spline let's make it editable 
[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=603) now adjust the proportions to make it closer to the reference image now use viewport solo mode to isolate it and switch to point mode in point mode we can select move and 
[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=623) adjust points very similar to polygonal objects it will be very convenient if we model one side and then mirror it that's why I want to place these two points right at the center of the coordinates 
[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=635) so go to the window menu and find coordinate manager it should appear down here just select two points and zero out the x coordinate I want to remove the 
[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=648) segment of the spline between these two points to do this select the object and uncheck close spline you can see that the wrong segment disappeared but now we know that these two points are 
[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=661) the first and the last points of the spline this is not very intuitive but all we have to do is just to correct the numbering of the points so that Center points become the last and the first 
[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=673) just select one of the points right click on a viewport and click set first point if it looks wrong like in my case try to select another point and do the same 
[11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=687) just click set first point now it looks right so these two points now the first and the last and there is no segment between them you can use transformation tools to adjust points if 
[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=699) you want to add a new Point hold down control or command on Mac and click on a segment let's create three more points like this it still looks too rectangular 
[11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=711) I want to change the interpolation between points to make it smoother to do that select the spline and in object tab you can change the type of interpolation between points now you can see it's 
[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=724) linear you can experiment with B spline or cubic for this case I think B spline is okay I don't like to move points one by one so I'm gonna use the magnet tool you can 
[12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=737) use shortcut MI it works similar to sculpting brushes you can also change the radius using third Mouse button it allows you to adjust several points at once 
[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=750) if you're happy with the shape let's select all the points then right click on a viewport to see the modeling tools menu and click mirror in attributes manager 
[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=763) select the proper mirror plane in my case is zy and hit apply but with splints is not as simple as with polygonal objects and you can see that these two points are not connected 
[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=776) I'll move it like this for clarity and to fix it select two points you want to weld then right click and find weld then select the point you want to collapse them to 
[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=791) now if I select these two points and do the same using weld you can notice that we have the same problem that's why in this case we will just 
[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=804) delete this point and make this spline closed if you want to adjust the shape a bit more you can use symmetry mode 
[13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=820) to make it look more like a lips let's give it some thickness select this plan object on a viewport hold down alt and create sweep object to make it work we need to use two splines 
[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=835) one spline for the rail and the second spline for the cross section let's use Circle adjust the radius a bit note that hierarchy matters the cross-section spline should be above the rails plane 
[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=849) now we can independently change the thickness of the lips and adjust the shape of the mouth using magnet tool next I'm going to look at the reference 
[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=863) and I will try to mimic different poses using magnet tool we just need to make sure that we have enough points to make all the different shapes of the mouth 
[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=891) here I don't like the uneven polygon distribution to fix it let's select our spline then set intermediate points to uniform and maybe adjust the number of polygons 
[15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=907) I think in our case 4 is enough I also want to remove these two points because the last points we have the easier to animate it and I think we have enough points to create any shape 
[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=924) now a temporary scale it down and adjust its position and orientation to make it look similar to the reference but it will be much easier to animate it as a flat object and then wrap around 
[15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=940) the face that's why let's select the sweep object and in coordinates tab let's zero out all the coordinates and then move it forward a bit along 
[15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=952) z-axis just to make it touch the face then hold down alt and create null rename it to mouth I don't want to adjust the mouth to the shape of the face every time that's why let's create 
[16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=965) band modifier and make it a child of the mouth null make sure that the long arrow pointing up and adjust its shape to fit the shape of 
[16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=978) the marshmallow and from this side it should have the width of the mouth crank up the strength to see how it deformed the object and in my case I need to fix the angle 
[16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=991) in my case a 90 degrees works good let's move the band modifier along y-axis so that it starts from the center of the body and you can adjust it so that it follows 
[16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1008) the shape of the cylinder now if I select all the points of the spline in points mode and move it along y-axis it will curve around the cylinder to make it work backwards select the 
[17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1024) bent modifier and set mode to Unlimited and one more thing you can see that the mouth is a bit distorted to fix this select the bend modifier and click keep length 
[17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1043) now I want to fix some little details just to make life easier in the future make sure that the mouth null is exactly at the center of the coordinates of X Y plane it means that X and Y should be 
[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1057) zero and it's moved forward a bit only along z-axis and it will be more convenient if the sweep object will be at the same place it means all the local coordinates should be zero I'll disable 
[17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1071) band temporary then in point mode I'll select all the points of the spline and move it right in the center let's check everything sweep coordinates are zeroed out and the same as mouth 
[18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1084) global coordinates now I can select the mouth now and move it a bit closer to the face after that I'll fit the shape of the band more accurately 
[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1097) such small changes seem unnecessary but in the process of work we will have more and more objects and if something goes wrong it will be much easier for us to fix it knowing that most of our 
[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1108) coordinates are zero now I can create any object for instance we can use Cube it can be anywhere in the scene you can move it inside the mouth now then in coordinates 
[18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1122) tab you can zero out all the coordinates it will appear in the center of the mouth and will be affected by a band modifier in our case it is very convenient because we can add teeth 
[18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1134) and for example this black plate inside the mouth now let's rename all the objects I'll rename spline to SPL lips and sweep to lips 
[19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1146) now I'll select the spline and in point mode I'll move the mouth up a little next I'm going to make the second pose to work with opened mouth let's 
[19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1156) temporary disable band and switch to front view select SPL lips and create pose morph tag we're going to use points you can see two pauses in this list bass pose 
[19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1171) and post zero make sure that you select an object tag and post 0 and if you adjust the shape using magnet new shape will be stored in post 0. now I'll speed up the video and sculpt the open mouth 
[19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1186) pose make sure that your scalp in the front view we need to keep this plant flat along z-axis you can also enable band and see how it changes in the camera 
[20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1205) view now we have two poses you can switch to animate mode and blend those two poses using this slider 
[20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1220) to make a black plate inside the mouth we can use the same spline I'll turn off the lips for now then isolate it and duplicate the spline I'll drag it out of the mouth and rename 
[20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1234) it to temp now select this new temporary spline hold on alt and create extrude extrude should become a parent of a spline 
[20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1246) I want to make the flat plate using the shape of the spline so let's go to Edge bits manager disable the cap on the back side and set of set to zero 
[20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1258) we need to bend it around the cylinder but we cannot bend and guns to fix it go to caps and change type to delineate it will allows us to deform this plate now we're using two different splines 
[21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1272) for the lips and for the black plate but I want the black plate automatically change its shape with the shape of the lips changes to make it work we'll use instance just select the spline of the 
[21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1284) lips and create instance and now we can use it instead of temporary spline then I'll select instance and zero out all the coordinates right away now we can change the shape of the spline and 
[21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1297) the black plate will change alone you can also move it independently for instance I want to move it a bit closer to the face let's enable band to see how it looks 
[21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1311) and we need to move the extrude inside the mouth now to be affected by the band you can fix some details I just want to move it a bit closer to the face and to see it better we can give it some 
[22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1329) color go to basic tab set display color to custom and select the color it will be easier to see intersections with the body 
[22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1341) next let's add teeth I want to isolate all the children of the mouth now so enable viewport solo hierarchy and enable viewport solo mode 
[22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1354) create a cube and we will make a tooth out of it move it closer to the mouth and adjust the proportions you can isolate it if you want 
[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1365) next we're going to use modeling tools so let's make it editable switch to polygon mode then select this polygon and remove I also flatten it a little more using 
[22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1379) the transform tools now switch to Edge mode and use Loop path cut I want to make Edge Loop in the middle so hold down shift and click on The 
[23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1392) Middle I'll select the edge on the bottom and move it down a bit next I'll switch to polygon mode and select all polygons 
[23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1404) right click on a viewport find subdivide and click on this little gear icon enable smooth subdivision we're going to use one iteration for now and click OK refine the shape a little 
[23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1419) bit and I want to extrude this Edge just hold down Ctrl command on Mac and use move note that now we have the axis in the middle of the tooth 
[23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1431) but I want to move it closer to the root to fix it use enable access then use move tool to move the axis and after that don't forget to disable access mode 
[24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1449) I want to place all the teeth along the spline and make it follow the shape of the spline every time it changes let's isolate tooth and spline and I 
[24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1460) also want to turn off the lips to snap an object to spline select an object then go to tags and create a line to spline tag then go to attributes and here you need 
[24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1474) to set the spline you want to use if you scroll the position you will see how the object slides along the spline if you want the object to be oriented along the spline 
[24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1487) enable tangential you can also adjust the axis here in this case z looks the best but it's still not exactly what we want the problem is that we cannot rotate it 
[25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1503) the way we want because its orientation is controlled by the tag to fix this select an object hold down alt and create a null then move align the spline tag from the 
[25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1516) object to the knob now it doesn't affect the object and we can rotate it as we want but the null still aligns to spline so we can change position of the tooth and we still can rotate scale and move 
[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1530) the tooth inside the knob let's rename all the objects I'll name it tooth let's enable lips now the tooth is too deep inside the 
[25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1542) lips but since we have this system we can move it out a bit in local space of the null you can switch coordinate systems using shortcut W or this button 
[25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1556) I'll just move it a bit along y-axis using this setup it will be very easy to duplicate teeth just hold down Ctrl or command on Mac and duplicate then select the tag and 
[26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1569) change the position let's see how it works while splendiforms let's place all the teeth inside the mouth now 
[26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1581) before that let's create a null parented to mouth and zero out all the local coordinates then rename it to teeth and place all the teeth inside the teeth 
[26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1595) now now let's check how it works with the band now let's check everything we can duplicate the tooth change its position band works properly 
[26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1608) you can also change the shape of the lips we also have a little problem note that when we change the shape of the mouth 
[26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1617) teeth are lagging behind a bit to fix it we need to place the teeth now below the lips so that the Align to spline tags evaluates after the spline change its shape 
[27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1634) now let's create lower teeth I'll just move it along the spline we got some orientation issues so select the object inside the null zero out all the coordinates then rotate and place it 
[27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1648) as you want then duplicate it once again and make the fourth tooth now let's check how it works we have some intersections but it's okay 
[28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1687) we will fix it on animation stage let's just rename everything to make it clear before making eyes let's see the reference and understand what 
[28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1710) functionality we need we have to solve several different problems for instance on this shot we can see that the eyes are strongly deformed this eye is melted also pupils have very different shape 
[28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1726) on the first image we can see Blue Iris the same on a second but here we have no Iris at all here you can see some wavy pattern along the edge 
[28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1738) let's try to recreate these effects but first let's check the radius of the sphere in my case it 18 and it will be more convenient to work in UC so click on 
[29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1751) this plus icon to create a new scene create sphere and make the same radius to make an iris let's create a disk adjust its radius and move it up a bit along y-axis 
[29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1769) I also change its color to make it easier to see I want to wrap this disk around the sphere but I want to keep the possibility to change the radius of the 
[29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1781) iris perfect choice for this task is shrink wrap modifier let's create it and make it a child of disk object then go to coordinates Tab and zero out all the 
[29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1793) coordinates then go to object tab and select the sphere as a Target object to make it fit better we need to increase the amount of polygons I'll just increase the rotation segments 
[30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1807) and disk segments we can see that this canal confirms the shape of the sphere so also we need to increase the resolution of the sphere now we can move and scale the iris the 
[30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1826) main thing is not to scale it too much let's add some shell select the disk object hold down alt and create cloth surface in attributes zero out subdivisions and 
[30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1840) Factor and increase thickness a little now let's disable everything except disk and try to recreate this wavy pattern let's create displacer 
[31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1861) make it a child of a disk object note that displacer should be above shrink wrap in hierarchy now it doesn't work because it uses height maps to displace the points so we need to use 
[31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1873) some height map to make it work you can go to shading Tab and here you can select Shader I'll select noise for instance you can see how this Placer move the points based on black and white 
[31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1885) Maps but now we're gonna use it a little different by default it moves points along the normals of the polygons but we need to 
[31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1895) move it outward from the center therefore go to object tab and set direction to spherical now it displaces points outward from the center of the displacer object so we need to 
[31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1909) place it right in the middle of the disk just zero out all the local coordinates looks better but not very good for now in our case we're not going to use the Shader let's select color 
[32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1924) make sure it's white now it displaces all the points evenly and use this height parameter as a distance and to make waves we're going to use fields 
[32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1938) for instance I can create spherical field it appears in object manager and viewport I'll scale it down a bit now the displacer affects only those points 
[32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1949) that are inside the field we can create several fills and mix them using different blending options I'll remove the spherical field and let's create a Shader field 
[32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1962) it should appear in object manager select it and set Shader to gradient note that points on the left side stays in place and the right side is displaced you can think of it as black as 0 and 
[32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1978) white is 100 switch gradient type to radial let's see how it works you can see the black color here it means that the points will stay in place 
[33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=1991) and in white area points will move 100 percent other points will have values between 0 and 1. one of the advantages of the fills is that we can remap the values go to 
[33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2005) remapping Tab and make sure it's enabled go down here and switch the mode to curve now we can reshape this curve and you can see how the shape of the gradient 
[33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2018) changes but the most interesting part is spline range it allows us to Loop the gradient let's increase it to 600. now it looks uneven because the original gradient has 
[33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2032) non-linear interpolation let me demonstrate on a simple example here I have the similar setup these cubes displaced by the gradient from 0 to 1. but the points between 0 
[34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2046) and 1 can have different values based on interpolation function for instance if I move this middle slider the shape will change if now I enable remapping and try to Loop this gradient 
[34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2062) you can see that cycle density is higher in the middle this is because the gradient changes slower on the sides and faster in the middle to fix this we need to make it linear 
[34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2075) therefore click this little arrow then select first black slider and change the interpolation to linear now we can see that the value change evenly so let's check how it will look 
[34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2089) after remapping let's do the same with the radial gradient just select this black nope and set the interpolation to linear 
[35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2110) now it looks even and beautiful and we can adjust the shape of this curve you can move points around if you want to create new Point hold down control 
[35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2121) command on Mac and click on a curve I also want to increase the spline range and we can adjust the height of the displacement displacer effects on all the points of 
[35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2141) the geometry based on fields that's why the polygons on the center are very stretched and shrink wrap cannot deform those polygons properly let's find out how to fix this issue 
[35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2156) to solve this problem select the displacer go to fields and create another Shader field for clarity I will temporarily change 
[36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2166) the direction of the displacement to vertex normal I want the center point to not move at all and the points that are closer to the end to move 100 percent for this 
[36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2180) let's select our second Shader field and I'm gonna disable the first field for convenience then go to fill tab and select gradient this time I'll set the type to Circular 
[36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2195) and this is exactly what we need the central points has zero values and closer to the sides it starts to rise to one I'll enable the first field 
[36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2207) then blend two Fields using blending by default we have Max let's change it to multiply now Fields values are literally multiplies in Center we have values which are close to zero and if we 
[37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2223) multiply it by any value the result will be very close to zero and on the sides we have values very close to one you can also think of it as a layers in Photoshop it works completely the same 
[37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2236) now we can adjust the gradient to achieve the result you want switch the displacer direction back to spherical and let's see how it works on a flat 
[37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2247) disk I'm gonna adjust it a little bit let's see how it works with shrink wrap now let's organize our scene create a null and rename it to I 
[37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2265) place all the objects inside the null and then move the sphere on the top of the list in the hierarchy I just want all the modifiers evaluates after the sphere 
[37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2276) let's rename everything I will add a prefix pupil to everything except sphere after that we will duplicate it and make an iris now select all the objects in object tab 
[38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2296) I switch display color to custom and adjust the color I also want to set icon color just switch to display color and icons will have the same color as object while holding Ctrl command on Mac 
[38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2308) duplicate all the objects and then change the color to something different in all the names replace pupil with Iris they intersect so let's adjust the thickness of the pupil shell 
[38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2332) I'll set something like 0.4 now we can adjust all the parameters of the pupil and Iris independently but during animation it will be not very convenient to search all the parameters 
[39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2346) in the hierarchy therefore let's create a simple interface to start let's try to do it on the example of the displacement height we can adjust the height of the pupil 
[39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2359) displacement and Iris independently but I want to control them both at the same time using one parameter for this select the I null then find user data menu and click manage user data click add 
[39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2374) user data and rename this parameter to waves height data type will be flawed set unit to real if you remember the height of this placement was about 5 Centimeters so 
[39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2388) let's set something between 0 and 10. I'll also set step 2.1 and default value I'll set to 4. then hit OK the user data tab should appear and it should have one parameter you can right click on it and 
[40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2403) make it float slider this slider doesn't control anything yet let's link some parameters select I null and create expresso tag you can see espresso editor now drag and drop the eye into this 
[40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2417) window now select the null go to user data then drag and drop waves height as an output of this node we want to control displacer parameters 
[40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2429) so drag and drop pupil displays here next find the height parameter then drag and drop it as an input now we can connect these two parameters let's check how this works 
[40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2442) waves height controls the height of the displacer object I want to control both displacers at the same time so duplicate this node then drag and drop Iris displays into 
[40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2454) this node then link Waits height with height and waves height Now controls both parameters at the same time to select the node you can change the 
[41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2465) color in attributes tab it could be very helpful if you have a lot of objects and nodes I'll close espresso editor for now and let's add more parameters 
[41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2476) select I null find user data click manage user data then add data let's call it rotation data type plot and set units to degree everything else 
[41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2490) is okay so let's add another parameter click add data and this time we call it size we're going to control the radius of the iris set units to real 
[41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2504) and set limits from 0 to 10 centimeters default value could be like 5. and the last parameter we will use to control the radius of the pupil regardless of the radius of the iris 
[41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2517) so I'm going to call it something like pupil scale here I'll leave percents because I want it depends on the size of the iris and I'll set default value to 50 percent 
[42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2529) now hit OK and you should have four parameters in user data you can convert them to sliders if you want next we're gonna link everything with other parameters 
[42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2542) to do so double click on espresso tag to reveal expresso editor drag and drop pupil mesh inside espresso and let's figure out what axis we're going to use for rotation 
[42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2557) I'll select pupil mesh and check different axes in my case it is H so drag and drop it as an input we also need to add other user data parameters into inode as an outputs 
[42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2577) let's link rotation with rotation H and check how it works duplicate pupil mesh node then drop an iris mesh into it I also want to change colors for clarity 
[43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2597) connect rotation parameters now pupil and Iris rotations controlled by one parameter we're going to use size parameter to control the radii of the disks so let's 
[43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2610) add both radii inputs respectively I'll select Iris mesh find radius and drop it into Iris mesh node let's connect it to size and check the maximum value is 10 for now I think 
[43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2626) it's not enough but we will fix it later let's also connect the pupil radius just drag and drop it into a null as an input and Link it with size parameter pupil and Iris now have the same radius 
[44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2640) because they control by one parameter at first I want to adjust the maximum size that's why select I null and go to user data font size and change the max value 
[44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2652) I'll set it to 15 and I also want to set step to 0.1 now the maximum size is 15 next I want to control the pupil scale using this parameter the main idea is to 
[44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2666) make it from 0 to 100 of the radius of the iris to do so go to search bar and find math drag and drop it into editor this node can add subtract or multiply 
[44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2681) two inputs in node tab select multiply and the result of this node will be the product of these two inputs all that we need to do is just multiply size by a pupil scale and we get the 
[44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2694) percentage of the size then connect the output to Outer radius of pupil mesh now if we change the pupil scale from zero to one hundred percent the pupil radius will change from zero to Iris radius I 
[45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2709) want to fix one more detail if we set pupil scale to 1 we'll get some intersections that's why go to user data and set max value to something bigger than 100 I'll set 110. it allows us to 
[45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2724) make it a little bigger than the iris let's check all the parameters it will be very convenient to animate using this setup if you want you can create some other parameters for instance you can 
[45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2736) create parameter to control the number of waves next I want to add an ability to deform the shape of the eye therefore select an eyeball 
[45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2747) hold on alt and create ffd deformer it should appear as a child of an eyeball click fit to parent to fit the proportions to the eyeball you can switch to point mode then select and 
[46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2760) move points and this way you can deform the object also you can use magnet tool or sculpting brushes to change the shape this way you can give the eye an expressive cartoony feel now it affects 
[46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2773) only the eyeball to make it affect other objects drag it out of the eyeball and place inside eye now select ffd former and increase grid size just a little because pupil and Iris slightly sticks 
[46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2787) out from the eyeball let's try to deform it a bit and for some reason FFG has some issues with my setup for instance if I disable and enable Iris shell you can see some 
[46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2801) weird glitches I found a little solution for this just select an eyeball hold down alt and create connect object and also put pupil and Iris inside then go to connect attributes and then 
[46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2814) check weld now ffd will perceive it as a polygonal object if irritate connect object it will be deformed by FFG after rotation we cannot see colors of the objects so I 
[47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2829) temporarily create two materials and apply it to Iris and pupil just for the sake of clarity this setup allows us to rotate the eye and deform it at the same time we can 
[47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2841) give it any weird shape and it creates the illusion that the iris slides along the surface of the eye and we still have the ability to change the radius of the pupil and its shape now let's reset all 
[47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2854) the parameters we can also reset FFG in object tab then select connect and zero out all local coordinates I'll also rename it to I 
[47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2867) and rename I now to RI which is right I'll remove materials for now because they will not work with redshift then select the ri and hit Ctrl or command plus C to copy 
[48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2886) switch to original project and paste it place it properly where you want it to be duplicate and call the second ili 
[48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2905) and remove the old spheres I also want to hide the fft deformers so that they doesn't interfere in viewport to better distinguish the pupils I want to create two different materials for 
[48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2920) Iris and pupil go to materials manager and create a shift material I will change on the color I'll set something like blue for the iris then drag and drop this material onto 
[48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2936) Iris shells of both eyes then hold down Ctrl command on Mac and duplicate the material change the color to Black and apply it to both pupils 
[49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2949) if you want you can rotate eyes a little just remember that you shouldn't rotate nulls F of these must stay in place so we're gonna rotate connect objects 
[49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2961) this way will rotate the eyes in animation stage we're almost done with the face only tongue left to be done we're gonna make it out of a cube so create a cube and 
[49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2977) adjust proportions to match the reference something like this it will be more convenient to make it in separate project so hit Ctrl command 
[49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=2990) plus C to copy create new project and paste zero out local coordinates increase amount of segments along y-axis I'll set about 15 we need this because 
[50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3003) we're going to bend it and set segments X to 4. we will use modeling tools so let's make it editable switch to polygon mode 
[50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3015) select four bottom polygons and delete I'll switch to point mode and use transform tools to shape the top part like this in edges mode I want to select the part 
[50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3037) of the edge Loop select one Edge where you want to start while holding down Ctrl command plus shift click on the other Edge this way you can select Edge Loops 
[50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3048) partially when this Edge Loop is selected I'm going to use bevel just click and drag a little like this while the bevel still active set 
[51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3060) subdivision to 1 so that we have additional Edge Loop here now double click on the edge to select an edge Loop and move it inside a bit I want to see how it looks in 
[51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3076) subdivision for this reason I'll select an object and while holding down alt create subdivision surface looks fine to me but for now we don't need subdivision so let's remove it 
[51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3090) now switch to point mode then in front view select all the points and move them up so that the bottom part corresponds to the center of the coordinates now the rotation should be around the root of 
[51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3103) the tone we're going to animate some wavy motion along the tongue and the setup will be very similar to Iris waves and to make it work we need the right UV 
[51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3114) coordinates let me explain what I mean for this reason I'll create temporary disk if you make it editable you can see that it has UV tag 
[52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3126) to see how it looks let's switch to UV edit layout the problem is that Shader Fields uses UV coordinates to apply texture maps in the case of disk we already have the 
[52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3141) proper UVS that's why shaders worked correct let's see how it looks in the case of our model in my case it looks pretty fine but let's pretend that something 
[52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3151) went wrong and I'll show you how to fix it for example you can have no UV tag at all I'll remove this disk and I'll remove 
[52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3161) the UV tag to create a UV on an object you can create any material for example you can create standard material drag and drop it onto object 
[52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3175) set projection to flat and you can adjust the projection plane using texture mode in this mode you can move scale and rotate the projection plane we need this 
[53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3188) plane to be parallel to the tongue it is already what we need also we need to stretch the projection of the tongue to fit the borders of the projection plane especially top and bottom Parts along 
[53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3201) v-coordinate we needed to run the gradient across the tongue from the root to the tip of the tongue to make it perfect right click on the material tag then find generate uvw coordinates now 
[53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3216) we have UV tag and you can remove the material tag now I'm going to stretch this projection so that the root corresponds to null and tip corresponds to 1. switch to polygon mode 
[53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3228) then select all the polygons then find UV packing tab right here then hit apply by the way check boxes should be like mine stretch to fit and preserve orientation 
[54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3241) now switch back to Startup layout and to check UVS let's create a material or use the old one drop it onto object set projection to uvw mapping now it will use UV tag projection then in 
[54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3257) material attributes set texture to gradient in my case UV coordinates are correct gradient spreads along u-coordinates so we can change it to V now the points that are closer to the 
[54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3270) root will have zero values and vice versa if you have the same result remove the material tag and material now select the cube and while holding down shift create displacer it should be 
[54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3284) a child of a cube go to attributes shading and set Shader to color make sure it's white then select displacer points displaced along normals 
[54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3296) this time set direction to planar then set the orientation axis to plus c now displacer will move all the points along z-axis now go to fields and create Shader field 
[55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3312) in Shader attributes set Shader to gradient you can see it runs along U coordinate so let's switch it to V in my case everything works perfect 
[55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3327) now let's add remapping go to remapping tab make sure it is enabled set counter mode to curve if you remember and adjust multiplier 
[55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3340) we also need to correct the shape of the spline let me remind you if you want to create a point just hold down Ctrl or command on Mac and click on a spline I also want to decrease the spline range 
[55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3352) a bit and decrease the displacer height during the animation we're gonna use a spline of set parameter one thing I want to fix is the root of the tongue I want to keep it in place during the animation 
[56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3375) so I will use another gradient I'll just duplicate existing Shader field and rename it to mask this time disable remapping 
[56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3388) and we need to add it to the list of displacer fields just drag it and drop here and set blending mode to multiply this way the root points will be less 
[56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3401) affected by the displacer you can adjust the second gradient to achieve the effect you want now I'll speed up the video and slightly adjust all the values 
[57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3426) I like this effect in general let's temporarily disable the displacer I want to make an effect of tank rolling out from the mouth in this case we can create very simple setup for this create 
[57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3440) band modifier and make it the child of the cube make sure that the long arrow goes along the tongue then click fit to parent select the proper angle in my case it is 
[57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3453) 90. I want to make it look like it rolls out so I will increase the strength and decrease the size a little along y-axis now if you move the bank modifier along 
[57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3470) y-axis it will look like it rolls out let's rename it to roll and rename the geometry to tongue in order to add a bit more life I'll duplicate this role and make a little 
[58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3489) back band I'll rename it to band adjust strength to something negative and move it down a bit like this now we have everything to animate the 
[58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3503) tongue let me tell you my plan at the start I'll use roll to roll it out then I will use band to add the secondary motion 
[58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3513) at the same time we will turn on displacer and start to animate spline range parameter in this particular case we're not going 
[58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3524) to create some complicated control system because the whole animation of the tank will take something about five or six frames let's create a parent now and rename it to tongue 
[58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3538) now copy this now then go to original project and paste adjust its position and orientation like this 
[59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3552) and also check how it looks in a scene I'll make it invisible for now because we will need it only in the end and let's organize the project a bit create null rename it to face put all 
[59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3576) the face objects inside I also want to create separate null for the eyes put it interface drag and drop ice inside the null and do 
[59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3592) the same with eyelets also rename it respectively L eyelid and R eyelid and the last null I'm gonna call it body and place the body inside 
[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCc3MjsWOys&t=10s&t=3608) now hierarchy looks clean and beautiful and you can save the project

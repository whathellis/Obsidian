Description:: This tutorial on Blender Animation is designed for individuals who are new to Blender or Animation. Join me as we explore the fundamental aspects of animation and become familiar with animation inside Blender. We dive into the principle of Exaggeration and Overlapping Action. We also use the power of Overshoots in our work.

For your convenience, I have developed a complimentary blender bouncing ball rig specifically for this tutorial. Feel free to download the rig and begin practicing today.

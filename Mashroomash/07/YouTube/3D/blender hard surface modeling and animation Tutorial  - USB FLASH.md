blender hard surface modeling and animation Tutorial  - USB FLASH
(Description:: in This video we gonna make a usb flash animation .. 3d product ad type of animation .. it's a very simple animation nothing is complex . )
this tutorial is not a professional tutorial , it''s just a practice that I wanted to share with you Guys .. 

what you need to follow this tutorials is :
You need to know some basics , like how to use booleans ,bevels , and  how to model basic shapes .. if you don't know these you need to watch some basics Tutorials before starting to try this :D .. 

this tutorial contains modeling , texturing , lighting , animation , 
there is no audio explanation , but there is a text explanation .. So if you don't understand any step pls feel free to ask me in the comms .. 
i used blender add-on called hardop and boxcutter for the booleans and the mirror modifiers , 

if you don't have these add-on you can get it from here (it's not Free ) ..

or use the normal modifiers it's fine . 

For the texture i used a Free version add-on called Real Time materials :

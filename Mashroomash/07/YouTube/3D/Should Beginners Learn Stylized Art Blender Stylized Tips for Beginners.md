Description:: In our Stylized Station Discord, one of the bigger debates is whether beginners should learn stylized art right away or if they should stick to realism, to get the foundations down. 

Eshaan stops by Stylized Station to talk about the benefits of learning stylized art as a beginner, as well as a ton of tips and tricks every beginner should know when working on a stylized scene in Blender.

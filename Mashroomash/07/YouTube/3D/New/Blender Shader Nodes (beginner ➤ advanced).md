[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=0) you want to learn Shader nodes I know Shader nodes in this video I'm going to teach you what I know it's going to be fast so if you can't hang slow it down but we're going from nothing to 
[00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=7) everything here we go this video sponsored by scolare and we're going to talk about that in a bit so in blender when you're doing shading you go to surprise surprise the shading workspace 
[00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=14) and this is where we do our work a object inherits a material and what we do in the material is reflected in the object so if I get rid of everything and maybe put down a plane I can give this a 
[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=22) new material where I'm going to call this teaching you and then anything we do here is reflected on that object and of course if I add another object it can inherit the same Contex of material and 
[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=30) then this changes both of them okay so objects inherit a material for most of this course we're just going to be using a grid cuz it's easy to visualize so make sure you're either in look Dev or 
[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=38) rendered mode I'm mainly going to be in look Dev and we're going to look from the top view and let's kind of expand this so you can see what we're doing the whole time so as you can see we have a 
[00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=45) default node set up with this weird node called the principal bsdf but what matters is that that is piping into the surface of the material output if I get rid of this it's going to be black cuz 
[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=53) nothing is piping into it if I do this now we're going to have something piping into it I can create a different node maybe this one's going to be red and now we can switch between the two so without 
[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=60) knowing what this means all you need to know is that a link sends information into the surface of the material output we'll talk about volume and displacement the simplest thing we can plug into the 
[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=68) surface is just a number so shift a to add nodes I'm going to type in value you're going to learn the names of these as we go connect this to this by the way if you're wondering how I do all these 
[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=75) like quick things there's an add-on called node Wrangler so in add-ons type node Wrangler and enable it there's a lot to learn with it but basically you hold down alt and right click drag to do 
[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=83) surface control and right click drag so it cut and then there's a few more so we connect the value to the surface and you can see as I change this it is going to change the brightness of the thing a 
[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=91) value is just a number where zero means black and one means white and then 0. five is gray in between and it turns out you can actually go above one so if I make a 10 you can see it's actually 
[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=99) noticeably brighter and it turns out you can also go negative but that's still going to look like black because anything below zero is going to look whack but it is actually storing this 
[01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=106) number where we can add in a math node which we'll talk about in a second I can multiply by1 and we get white back because -1 * 1 is equal to one which means this must be storing the value by 
[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=116) the way I like using snapping here to make sure that everything I do is in this like nice grid where you know everything's organized as you might expect we can take values and add them 
[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=123) together so we can have different nodes with different values our next most important node is the math node and this is how we combine them so I've added these two values if I make them both 
[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=130) zero it's black if I increase one you know either one it's going to get brighter and if I do 0. five on both this is going to equal one cuz it's .5 * 2 and if I compare this to a value of 
[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=138) one it's going to look the same cuz they're both a value of one there's a whole list of operations here most of them you know like add subtract multiply whatever but there's probably some you 
[02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=145) don't know we're not going to use most of these but one important one is sign so we have signs and cosiness where as you increase this it's going to go from black to white to black to white so this 
[02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=151) is a good way to kind of have repetition where we're using this sine wave right where we have bright areas repeating and then dark areas repeating if we have a single number you might wonder can we 
[02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=159) have multiple numbers the answer is yes a simple way to think about this is you can actually bring in a color so instead of value you have a note called RGB that's red green blue you view it and 
[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=167) basically it you know represents the color of whatever you pick here pretty simple now the reason I call this multiple numbers is you can see it says red green blue this is actually three 
[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=174) numbers where if I open this you can see if we go to RGB there's literally three numbers so if I set the first number to one it's going to be be red if I set the second number to one it's going to be 
[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=181) red plus green which is kind of this yellowish and if I have one on all it's going to be white and if all these are zero going to be black so these are three numbers representing a color and 
[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=188) really what this is is it's something called a vector a vector is basically a list of numbers that you know generally has more than one in this case we have an XYZ or red green blue instead of a 
[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=197) color we can also just use a straight up Vector these are basically the same thing but we just think about them a bit differently where again we have red green blue essentially if I set X to one 
[03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=204) it's red if I set y to one it's kind of the yellowish it's the exact same thing the difference with this node versus the RG B node is you're going to see that this one actually has connections which 
[03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=212) means we can vary what's going on so for example in the X component and you can just drag and write something in I'm going to have the sign of some value okay so now it's going black to Red so 
[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=220) black to red and then let's also do one on the Z so this is going to be blue and for the value I can connect the same number to both of these so this is our most complicated Network yet the way you 
[03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=228) want to read this is we have a number that is going through two sign functions and one's going to X and one is going to Z you can see it's going black to purple black to purple or kind of the magenta 
[03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=235) and you might wonder if these are the same why don't I just use a single one of these that is correct going to give the same but the reason we might want to separate these is I want to do different 
[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=242) things for red and blue for example I can add an offset of let's say Pi here so now these sine waves instead of being like in sync one is like this and then the other is perfectly out of sync in 
[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=252) fact it's actually a cosine wave where now you can see there's more going on it's going red to blue to red to blue and by the way just a tip if you don't want to key frame or animate this you 
[04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=259) can click this type hashtag which basically means I'm going to make an expression type in frame and this is literally going to give the frame number so I'm on frame 25 which means that this 
[04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=266) is going to be 25 and as I go down I'm going to do that additionally I can take this and divide it by something like 10 this is going to take the frame number it's going to divide it by 10 which 
[04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=274) means it's going to be smaller which means it's going to move slower and now we have the same thing but it's a slow Evolution remember I can apply this material to any object so this has the 
[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=282) same material and now they are both flashing just like we can add numbers or values together so to can we add vectors so here I have two vectors this is a vector math node so instead of a math 
[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=290) node there's something called a vector math node each one of these can inherit a custom vector or if you don't need this control you can just type it in right here so red plus blue is equal to 
[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=297) purple or I can add even more red and it's going to be brighter maybe some green if all of these are negative 1 which does represent a negative thing but it's going to show up as black and 
[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=305) then I add a value of two it's going to be white because negative one on each component plus two on each component is equal to one on each component these are a bit more confusing you might not know 
[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=312) them but some of them are familiar add subtract multiply divide if I have Zer times any vector and we multiply it um nothing's going to change cuz it's always going to equal zero but if I set 
[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=320) this equal to one basically only the second ve Vector is going to represent cuz we multiply by one which means it doesn't change now so far we've outputed a vector or a single number to this 
[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=327) whole surface right anything we do is reflected on the entire surface but what if I want one area to be black one area to be white and maybe a gradient going between them well this is where we 
[05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=335) introduce Wess and since we are together learning about blender Shader nodes you need to know about the best place to learn things online which of course is skillshare skillshare is the best place 
[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=344) to learn things online whether that be digital skills life skills it's got it all there's all kinds of categories so you could do film and video that seems relevant to us as like Wonder people 
[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=352) graphic design even more so animation and we could even get specific let's do blender 3D and you can see all kinds of courses some of which are are very like recent like the Dune stuff all kinds of 
[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=362) people that actually seem quite familiar we also have learning paths what these are is they're basically like a curated sequence of a bunch of like horses one after another after another that tied 
[06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=370) together so you go from Zero to Hero so recently I've been making a weird like website where you can like type things in and it's a fun text editor with sound and all this fully dependent on HTML 
[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=380) which I don't know much of so let's say we type in HTML here you have HTML and CSS for beginners code your first website it's basically the idea of how do you make a web page Without Really 
[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=388) knowing what that is made by Rich Armstrong this is a course that is super helpful if you don't know the idea of tagging what are divs and all of these things it is summertime I don't know if 
[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=396) you've looked outside what that means is that you have a lot of time to learn something online and finally do that thing you'd said you do whether that's like making a website or learn 3D 
[06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=403) animation or whatever it might be so you guys can check out skillshare and if you use my link in the description the first 500 people to do so will get a one month free trial of skillshare which is plenty 
[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=411) of time to watch a lot of stuff there is a coordinates node it's called texture coordinates and you're going to see all these things that look confusing generated normal UV object camera 
[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=418) windowed coordinates which is interesting cuz it actually depends on where it is on your screen and if we use one of these simple coordinate systems like the UV coordinates you're going to 
[07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=425) see that we basically have a graph going on here where in the bottom left corner it's completely black so this is a value of zero down here and then as we progress this way you can see it gets 
[07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=433) redder and redder and redder this actually represents the x- axis which is also represented by red and this means we're increasing on X until we get an S equal to 1 conversely if we go up this 
[07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=442) Dimension right it gets Greener and Greener and Greener just like the y- AIS is green until we get a value of one and then if we go diagonal we're increasing both X and Y at the same kind of rate so 
[07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=451) up here we expect a vector of 1 comma 1 this is a two-dimensional Vector but actually it is a threedimensional vector in a way uh because we have a z coordinate that is suppressed so instead 
[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=459) of 1 one this is one for the X one for the Y and then zero for the Z is what's actually going on here which means if I take these UV coordinates and this is a vector right you can see this kind of 
[07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=467) purple output I can do a vector math right so nothing changes but if I add a bit of Z component you can see it's getting a bit more blue because we can add a kind of tertiary component the Z 
[07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=475) component you're going to notice that this one is called UV and that is no accident we can actually go to our UV editor and whatever we do with these UVS translates right so this is kind of the 
[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=484) bottom left black corner and if we shift it you can see now the kind of Center Point is in the middle cuz this is the area on the bottom left like I said there's an X increasing and there is a y 
[08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=492) increasing can we look at one at a time yes because if we can take a vector and write it as a combination of XYZ right so too can we separate a vector so I'm going to separate XYZ and now instead of 
[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=501) this two-dimensional actually threedimensional coordinate system I can see the X component increasing remember black means zero so this is an X component of zero and as we increase we 
[08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=508) get brighter equal to one same thing with the Y AIS and you bet that we can do all kinds of operations like addition right so now you can see that has more of a visual effect or I can take X and Y 
[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=517) and include both of them where we now add their components this is going to be equal to zero cuz X is z and y is z we add them as equal to zero and then up here you can expect a value equal to two 
[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=525) cuz X is equal to 1 and Y is equal to 1 and we added them let's multiply them together now we get a more interesting result where we have x * Y and you can almost see this kind of like I forget 
[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=534) the name there there's a name for this curve I don't know if it's hyperbola or whatever but it's no coincidence that you can actually see this curve which which is kind of the equation you're 
[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=540) used to graphing in fact I can take this and look at where this value is equal to something so I can use the compare function so this is a new one you can see there's actually three inputs what 
[09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=548) we do is we compare input one to input two and we use this Epsilon value to say where are they almost equal to each other right so as I decrease this you're going to see it kind of gets thinner 
[09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=556) because our threshold for where these are equal are kind of kind of getting Slimmer so let's see where x * Y is equal to.5 with an Epsilon of something very tiny well what you can see is that 
[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=566) this generates a curve that I can actually sweep right this is literally the equation let's do .25 what I'm doing is I'm checking where x * Y is equal to .25 with a bit of a plus or minus with 
[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=576) this Epsilon you can make it really tiny so it almost generates the exact her and if you rearrange this equation we have y is equal to .25 / X which you might recognize as the equation for whatever 
[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=585) this thing is called can we graph other things we sure can let's actually take X and take the sine wave of it and what I'm going to do is I'm going to compare where the S of X is nearly equal to Y 
[09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=594) okay and you can see it kind of gives this gentle curve but we don't actually see our sine wave and this is because again X is going from 0 to 1 so we can only go from s of 0 to S of 1 and 
[10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=603) remember a sine wave has a period of 2 pi it takes 2 pi of input to get from you know one place of the other which means if I take our X component now and multiply it you can actually just write 
[10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=611) 2 * the I pi and we get a kind of a sine wave you can see we have the top part but why do we not see the bottom part here let's think about it well remember our y goes from 0 to one whereas sign 
[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=620) can get Negative which means it's down here which means we can't see it if I actually take this sine wave and let's say we take kind of the inverse I'm going to multiply by negative 1 now we 
[10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=628) get the other section cuz we f it around additionally I can take something like a absolute value and now we get this hump because the sine wave was like this this is the negative component and I'm saying 
[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=635) make it positive but what if I wanted to capture the full sine wave also this negative well in that case I need to remap our y 0 to 1 to something like it should be able to go down here negative 
[10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=644) 1 to 1 cuz that is the co- domain of the sign function well there's actually a node for that it's called map range the range is basically how far does this go again y goes 0 to 1 but I want to 
[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=653) increase the range to go from Nega 1 to 1 and what you can do is we said we're looking at the Y component we're going from 0 to 1 and I want to remap that to 1 to 1 and now we get our sine wave 
[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=661) where I can multiply and get let me make this a bit thicker so we can see where we can get kind of multiple period of the sine wave and one thing to note about what we're doing here is it has 
[11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=669) infinite resolution no matter how much I zoom in there won't be pixelation because this is a mathematically perfect equation by the way remember all of this is ultimately dependent on our UV 
[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=676) coordinates which means I can basically I guess I can basically stretch it because if I stretch it our UV coordinates don't change so it's forced to still use this whole area so it 
[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=683) stretches but I can do something more complicated like let's say I do a Taurus it inherit this material well now you can see it's doing something very weird and it's not making a sine wave from 
[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=691) like the top perspective because our Taurus has its own UV map if I go to the UV editor you can see our Taurus has this map and I can move it around so too can I take this UV coordinate and Sample 
[11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=699) different sections of this by the way if you're noticing that there's this very weird kind of like section over here that's because our map range strictly goes between negative 1 and one without 
[11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=706) any kind of leeway for going above one right like when we go to 1.1 two it doesn't like that and same with the negative you can change that by hitting this clamp where we're no longer 
[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=714) clamping we're no longer saying this is a limit um with this thing by the way clamping you're going to see an option in all these math nodes it's basically saying if we have a negative value so 
[12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=721) let's say we have our timeline here is zero here is one and here is negative 1 we're saying this whole section all the negative should just become zero when we clamp and you can see that over here it 
[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=729) kind of becomes a flat line now what if we want to make a more complicated shape like let's say we want to make a circle well if we want to make a circle we kind of need to know the equation for that 
[12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=736) well a circle is basically the set of points that are equidistant from the center so if this is the center you're going to see every point in the circle is the same distance of the radius away 
[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=743) from that if you'll remember the radius which is basically a distance is calculated by the Pythagorean theorem x^2 + y^2 is equal to kind of like z^ s but we take a square root and now this 
[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=751) is a distance basically so if I want to calculate the circle at 5.5 so we go halfway on the X halfway on the Y what I need to do is kind of do this calculation so I'm going to take the UV 
[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=760) coordinates and I'm going to separate them so we have X and Y and I want to know kind of the distance from this uh Center which we can calculate by subtracting .5 so you can see now it's 
[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=767) kind of moved to the center by the way this is going to be negative values which you can correct for by just taking a absolute value ultimately doesn't matter cuz we're going to square it so 
[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=774) we have x^ s compared to5 so let's take a power of two so this is squared and then we're going to take y^2 and we are going to add these together I'm just doing the equation and now you can see 
[13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=783) we kind have the outline of a circle and finally we are going to take a square root and we want to check where this is like equal to one for example and we know how to do that already I can 
[13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=790) compare this time to Output to the number let's say .5 with a Epsilon that is very tiny 25 and now we have the equation for Circle we can pick a different radius for but notice before 
[13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=799) we did our compare we had something called a field a field is basically saying each point on the surface has a different like value we're evaluating at every shading point where the center is 
[13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=807) quite black cuz the distance from from the center to the shading point is very tiny and then as we go further away it gets bigger which means we could do all kinds of things with this we don't need 
[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=814) to say where this is less than or greater than or equal to something I can actually take this and let's get weird I can take the sine wave of this and we don't see it quite yet cuz again we need 
[13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=821) more periodicity so I'm going to multiply this by a bigger number and now you can see we actually have something more complicated so originally we basically had a function that tells us 
[13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=828) the distance from the center and along this I'm calculating a sine wave so now if I take this and do some kind of comparison so I'm going to compare here to like25 uh you can see we got 
[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=836) something more complicated let me lower this Epsilon by like that you can also kind of offset over time so we changed our periodicity I can also add to change the phase and this is something we can 
[14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=845) do over time so I'm going to write Ash frame you're not going to see it cuz it moves quite quickly so I'm going to do the frame number divided by 10 just like before and now you can see these kind of 
[14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=852) ring I can also take our distance function which by the way if you want to put all this in one like category you can either take this and hit shift key to put it in a frame or a panel key for 
[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=860) panel or even better take it contrl G and now it's in something called a group so I'm just going to make this only have a single output instead of like one two outputs so this is shift click right 
[14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=868) drag I'm going to take Control G this is a node group and I'm going to call this distance so this is our distance evaluator and then I'm running all kinds of MTH to do something like that but I 
[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=876) can take this distance field and do other things so let's do a map range so again uh this distance basically goes from zero and then it increases to one to two and I keep going well I can take 
[14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=884) this range and invert it 0 to 1 to 1 to zero or I guess I want to make this tinier now we kind of have this soft Circle because we're limiting it from 1 to zero and I can take our kind of sonar 
[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=892) thing and then multiply it by this and you can see now we have the same thing but it's kind of limited and if we think of this as a sonar it should should probably be green so I can combine XYZ 
[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=901) remember this is a vector with three numbers if I want my Sonar to be green we need to increase the y or the green component so I'm going to put this here I'm going to view it and now we have a 
[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=909) green sonar where we can increase the Epsilon to kind of get this more visible sonar or multiply the periodicity to get a more dense sonar by the way if you don't want this shrinking to the middle 
[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=917) but instead expanding outwards all I need to do is take this and invert it so you can take the frame number take the negative frame number and now it's going outward or simply you can just take this 
[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=925) output and multiply it by 1 okay so we have our sonar but we need something to be detected by the sonar so let's say we have kind of like a Target over here so in other words we have a circle that 
[15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=933) should be showing up on the sonar well remember we actually already know how to do this this is basically the circle I can take our UV coordinate calculate the distance but now I don't want the 
[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=941) distance from the center I want the distance from something like over here well one way to do that is I can either take our UV coordinate and kind of offset them which also kind of does the 
[15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=948) right thing let say I don't want to mess with my UV coordinates I just want to mess with our distance well remember we're calculating the distance from the center so hit tab to go inside of here 
[15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=954) we're calculating the distance from X value5 so Y value5 what if I want one distance function to calculate from the center and another from here so you want to duplicate and these do different 
[16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=962) things well the issue is so these are the same right now the issue is if I change one of them it changes the other these are the same now so I want these to basically be independent and I want 
[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=969) to control the X and Y without going in here well if I go in here and take the X component and do this I'm adding it to the group input these are now input I can change the X and Y where you can see 
[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=977) we have numbers that are exposed and these will give us different results because one is looking for the center from like point2 to5 the other one is using 5 to5 so by the way if you don't 
[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=985) want these called value but you actually want to remember what they are go into the node hit and for the panel and you're going to see all these options where we can actually take this value 
[16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=991) rename it to X take this rename it to Y so you can see that updated here and then for the output we can call it distance and then for the coordinates we can call it coordinates instead of 
[16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=998) vector so now we know exactly what to do with this okay so we have our sonar but we also want to Target we know how to do this I use the distance I use the map range from before and now we have kind 
[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1005) of this like Circle that I can move and if I want to take before it becomes green but if I want to take our sonar M and then include or add this how do I combine them well I just said it we add 
[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1013) we combine their influence right so I can take this whole thing and I can add it uh to our Circle so now both are included in fact I can kind of make this sharper if I don't want it to be the 
[17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1021) soft Circle by saying so here we have our distance map that was inverted I want to make it a sharp Circle so I can just say take this field and tell me where it's greater than or less than 
[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1028) some numbers if I use greater than now you can see we have this and we include this into our green and now we have a sonar you're going to notice by the way that this overlapping section is a bit 
[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1037) brighter if you want that good if you don't that's an issue the reason it's happening is we have contribution from this where it's equal to one and also this where it's equal to one which means 
[17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1044) where they overlap it equal to two we don't want that well uh similarly to how we clamp the blast I can also the white values so we can't go below zero or above one another way to do it is 
[17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1052) instead of adding I can say we want to add them but only keep the bigger of the two and don't like literally just add them to become two well if we're keeping the bigger of the two that is called a 
[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1059) maximum this is another way to do it another way to do it is a minimum which will give us kind of the inverse you can think of that as a intersection I want this to also fade our DOT so all I need 
[17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1067) to do is kind of change the order of operations where I have this output and this output I'm taking the maximum so it combines them and then for this so I'm going to multiply by our like soft mask 
[17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1076) so now we get something like this a little hard to tell but if I move it towards the The Edge you can see kind of gets fainter and uh we make that green cool thing about this by the way is we 
[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1082) can just R this so remember we have our distance which we can modify for each one so maybe this one will be a bit to the left we put it through these same nodes by the way if you just want to 
[18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1090) keep it simple this which goes from our distance to a sharp Circle can also be a node group Control G so I'm going to call the Circle Maker here I can have our distance go into a circle maker but 
[18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1098) it's using a different distance input from the other one just like before we have our sine wave we have our Circle and we took the maximum between the two uh I want to also include our other 
[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1107) Circle so I can take this and then take another maximum right by the way alt s to kind of shift these although in this case it doesn't matter and now we have both circles that we multiplied by our 
[18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1116) soft map that we make green so this is our sonar and you can also have these targets move over time by saying we take the X component so let's actually do this explicitly I can take the X 
[18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1124) component that 33 and then we can add or subtract some value over time so that it's moving I'm just going to use a driver hash frame divided by 10 which will go a bit too fast so I'm going to 
[18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1133) divide by 100 and now it's slowly moving across the screen we can make it even slower whereas this I can also write hash frame divided by 100 here but this one I also add 052 so you can make your 
[19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1142) expression more wild but a sodar usually has this kind of like rotating thing that basically like scans as it updates it rotates well to do that I basically need a new function that takes our 
[19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1152) coordinate system and from the center kind of gives us the angle well class you'll recognize this as the poar coordinates where instead of cartisian coordinates right we go from X going 
[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1159) from 0 to 1 and y going to 0 to 1 and a point here is basically it's X component and then a y component a polar coordinate system is instead given by so instead of like X and Y it's given by an 
[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1168) angle and a radius right so this point right here is basically defined by the angle Theta from the x-axis and then the radius from the center or a point like this can be an even larger angle with a 
[19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1178) smaller radius so we're just kind of converting well uh we already know how to calculate radius from the center that's just our distance function going to put that here we're calculating the 
[19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1185) distance from the center 5.5 this is our radius which I can just rename to radius but we also need to calculate the angle of every Point well this is kind of a special trick where let's say we have an 
[19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1195) angle equal to Thea this angle is still defined by X and Y right so we go some components so let's say we have this we have some component on the X and some component from the Y and remember we 
[20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1204) want to calculate this angle over here and if you remember SOA sin cosine tangent you're going to see that this is the Opposites right the opposite over the adjacent right so tangent let's 
[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1213) write this down tangent of theta Theta is equal to opposite which in this case is going to be the Y component so opposite divided by adjacent which is the X component which means if I take a 
[20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1221) inverse tangent right on both Sid we're going to find that Theta is equal to the inverse tangent so inverse tangent of Y / X in other words we have a complicated equation for the angle if I want y/ X we 
[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1232) have our UV coordinates which are two dimensional actually three I'm going to connect this here so we get the X and the Y component and instead of doing this Division and inverse tangent 
[20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1239) there's already a function for us it's called AR tan 2 tan 2 does the division for you and some other thing where I can say this is y / X and now this is going to give an angle it's a little hard to 
[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1248) tell but it's going to give an angle from the center which is actually over here cuz we didn't shift it yet so remember our UV coordinates are equal to 0 0 down here we just didn't shift them 
[20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1255) but this gives an angle where I can do a greater than to see it gives an angle that sweeps but if I want to calculate the angle from the middle all I want to do is take our UV coordinates and shift 
[21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1262) them this way which means like we know you can take the vector math and do a I guess a subtraction or adding a negative so I subtract by. 5.5 right you might think that you want to add. 5.5 to get 
[21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1271) here but it's actually the inverse because if this is equal to 5.5 when we subtract 5.5 it becomes zero you're going to see it looks a bit weird uh the way this is working by the way is you 
[21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1279) can see it sweeps like this but then it kind of stops and it stops that not just a random number but a very specific number uh this number you might recognize as Pi but you can also go the 
[21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1286) other way right so the thing is this out a value 0 to Pi for an angle but then it's 0 to pi over here but what if I want it to go from 0 to 2 pi like normally well this section's fine this 
[21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1296) is the section I want to uh invert well if I want to invert the bottom section all I need to do is isolate it and then multiply by ne1 well how do I isolate the section this is where the Y 
[21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1304) component the Y the height the vertical is less than 0.5 right the bottom section in other words I can take this y component that we had from before I'm going to see where it is less than oh no 
[21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1313) we already did our shift here remember we did this so what I can do is either do it with a separate UV coordinate or let's just do with separate U coordinates to keep this simple so again 
[22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1320) I'm going to separate my UV coordinates I want to know where our y component is less than5 right this is the bottom section for this I want to take the r tangent and multiply by Nega 1 so the 
[22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1327) issue here is if I take this and then like multiply by this and then like multiply by negative 1 it all kind of gets a little weird so what I want to do is I want to say for this top section do 
[22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1335) nothing and for the bottom section multiply by Nega 1 well here is another important node it's called The Mix node what the mix node does is allows you to have two numbers like 0 and one and then 
[22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1342) you can switch in between them with a factor so when this is equal to one it's going to use the B and when this is equal to zero it's going to use the a I can can just have R tangent and then for 
[22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1349) B I can take the r tangent and like we said multiply by Nega 1 so something like that so we have R tangent and then this multiply by Nega 1 which you can see kind of inverts it and the 
[22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1357) difference between using A and B should be this kind of mask here so we do this and now you can see we have this isn't this is actually not exactly what we want but you can see now we have our 
[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1365) full spectrum where if I do a greater than it's actually going to give something different it's going to give this P wedge kind of like a packman Eden which is actually pretty interesting 
[22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1371) this is because we go from Zer to Pi but then in this section we're also going 0 to Pi so multiplying by negative 1 was kind of the right idea but really what I want is we had this is 0 to Nega Pi this 
[23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1380) should be remapped to Pi to 2 pi kind of kind of confusing but we know how to do this we have our Ran 2 and we know I just want to remap the range from remember it's going from you could do it 
[23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1388) either way let's say we're going from PI to or sorry negative pi to 0 we go from netive PI to 0 and that should become so right now it's going 0 to 1 this should become pi to 2 pi right I'm just 
[23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1398) redefining this and then this is what I want to have as our B component so now we have 0 to Pi and then for the bottom section pi to 2 pi and now we have a full sweep okay very complicated but 
[23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1406) kind of the takeaway here is now I can kind of a compare function where I can say where is this equal to let's say PI right which should be this Direction with an Epsilon 05 and as I sweep this 
[23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1415) it's going to give a circle by the way another issue uh when we go from zero it's good we increase we increase we increase and then we're at 2 pi and then it goes away why is that this is because 
[23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1422) our angle goes from 0 to 2 pi but then we don't increase right and then go to like 3 pi and 4 Pi it just goes from 0 to 2 pi which means this compare is going to break at a certain section so 
[23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1431) if I want to sweep I somehow need to say go from 0 to 2 pi and then go back to 0 and 2 pi and all this in other words the range 0 to 2 pi is totally weirdest two ever uh is totally fine but then as we 
[24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1440) go from 2 pi to 4 Pi um it should again become 0 to Pi same with 4 pi to 6 Pi basically we always need to bring it back in this case it would work by just subtracting 2 pi 2 pi would become Zero 
[24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1450) 4 Pi would become 2 pi Etc so let's actually just you know take a crack at this so what I can do is I can just well well let's actually do it as a value to keep this simple so here we have a value 
[24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1457) I'm going to take the frame number remember frame zero it's black and then it gets whiter we actually start on frame one it's white and then it gets even more white uh this is something 
[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1464) that should always remap 0 to 2 pi uh let's take this and first of all divide by 10 so that it grows much slower and then I want to know when this has exceeded 2 pi so I can take this and say 
[24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1474) when are you greater than let's say 2 pi right so in the beginning it's going to be black and then as we play eventually it's going to become white well in that case what I want to do is then remap it 
[24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1483) to the beginning and there's a MTH note for that it turns out it is called fraction what fraction does is let's say we have a timeline that increases from let's say zero to one to two what it 
[24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1491) does is it takes each one of these sections that's above 0 to 1 and it remaps it to the beginning the way it does this and the reason it's called fraction is let's say we have a number 
[24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1498) here like 1.3 what it does is it basically truncate it gets rid of this one which makes it equal to 2.3 which means it's remapped back here so to if we have 2.3 it will just get rid of the 
[25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1506) integer component and then remat to3 and it does this over and over and over again uh this with the fraction is going to be kind of Blackish and white and then it repeats because it keeps going 
[25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1514) from Zer to one over and over again but if I want it to go from 0 to 1 to 0 to 2 pi I just multiply this by 2 pi connect this here and let's see what we got we have our Circle and it goes on forever 
[25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1522) because we keep going 0 to 2 pi to make this slower I'm going to divide by 100 so what I am going to do is I'm going to take this whole nonsense over here and just keep it simple where I'm going to 
[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1530) control G to make this a node group so now we're a bit cleaner here by the way take a node crl H to hide every socket we're not using this is going to be our angle have our angle actually inside of 
[25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1538) here I'm going to bring back our compare node so I want to compare this to let's say zero with an Epsilon something a bit bigger okay actually we did that wrong we have our angle and then we compare it 
[25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1547) to the slight changing value with an Epsilon of something tiny I want to take this and add it to our sonar so remember we had our sonar we added a DOT we added another Dot and then we multiplied by 
[25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1555) our fade just like before we add one more maximum including our angle and now we have all these components that we dampen and we make a green no reason you can't take this and make it blue right 
[26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1563) using the Z component in fact here's a way you can think about it we can take a vector math which again is a threedimensional thing you could think of it as a color or a vector let's say I 
[26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1570) pick the color red I can take this and I can multiply it by this map right here which is 0 to 1 so I'm going to multiply by the way if you put a number inside a vector so let's say this is equal to 0.1 
[26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1578) what it does is it's not 0. 1 0 0 it makes it equal to 0.1 on X Y and Z it just treats it as a vector works the same everywhere now we have red and we can kind of change this nice and uh 
[26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1587) dynamically and pick a nice color I'm going to go for green and again everything we have here beauty of the noes completely uh controllable so I can bring down the uh periodicity and now we 
[26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1596) have a sparer sonar denser sonar okay let's move on to a different section we talked about numbers vectors and coordinates and now let's talk about threedimensional things right we've been 
[26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1604) stuff on two Dimensions okay so for part two I'm thinking we change what kind of coordinate system we're using we're mainly going to talk about normal coordinates and now our goal is to do 
[26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1611) more Vector map and create more interesting materials like Moss or grunge or dirt or whatever so this time we're going to use not a flat plain but very intentionally I'm using a mesh with 
[27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1620) kind of like curvature and different faces and in the shading workpace I'm going to apply a new material and just like we've been doing I'm going to bring in a coordinate system specifically 
[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1627) normal coordinates now what normal coordinates describe is not like the thing we're used to where we have kind of like an x a y z- axis and we know like how far along we are no a normal 
[27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1635) coordinate basically tells us what direction is facing outwards from the mesh so here it's this direction here is this direction you're going to notice this is actually going to change with 
[27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1643) the geometry so as I increase this and maybe give it a bit of rotation you can see that color is changing because now the direction that is going outward is changing additionally if I shade smooth 
[27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1651) it's going to smooth the coordinates unless of course we don't want that where we can use this geometry node don't worry about it where we have normal coordinates and true normal which 
[27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1658) don't change under shade smooth but we actually wanted to so why is something like this useful well it's useful to know which direction is outwards because then we can Define more complicated 
[27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1667) surfaces so instead of saying oh only extract the top section of this if I wanted something like Moss or dirt or whatever that only accumulates on the top but not on this like overhang over 
[27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1675) here this is where normal coordinates come in so for example let's say that again I want to drape something over the surface in other words I want it here I want it here I want it here but I don't 
[28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1684) want it in this direction cuz it's facing kind of downward well how do I describe that selection in three dimensions well here is a new operation that you might have not heard of it is 
[28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1691) called the dot product in Vector map and what it tells us is something about the angle in particular if I have a vector going upward so again a vector is a threedimensional quantity in this case 
[28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1699) it is zero on the X zero on the Y and one on the Z in other words this is the direction that's going straight up let's say I have this vector and then also the surface normal you're going to see in 
[28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1707) this case the angle between them is actually quite tiny which means they're almost align whereas somewhere like here we have our upwards Z vector and we have the surface normal and this angle is 
[28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1716) huge in other words if we can extract this angle we know what is kind of facing upwards and this is what dot product does so I'm going to plug in the normals and for the Cy Vector I'm 
[28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1723) comparing I'm going to use the Z up Direction when I view this you're going to see it gives this kind of interesting output that indeed kind of isolates the top of the mesh but more particularly it 
[28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1730) kind of gets rid of these overhangs and this is very sensitive uh to mesh deformation so you can see let me actually rotate it uh the other way you can see we're actually starting to 
[28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1738) reexpose sections of it as it's like pointing upwards now the dot product doesn't actually give you an angle what it does is it compares the two vectors and then gives you a value between -1 
[29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1747) and 1 very similar to S and cosine it turns out though that you can take this and convert it into an angle using the special formula the dot product of two vectors the first one's going to be 
[29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1755) called V the second one's going to be called W cuz I say so this is basically equal to something related to the angle but really it is the coign of the angle which tells us we're going to need to 
[29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1763) take a inverse cosine to extract this and then I believe it also cares about the magnitude of the like how big or long are they so it might not exactly be this but I think it's the magnitude of e 
[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1771) times the magnitude of w but if we can make sure that these are both equal to one then we don't actually care about that and to make sure that our vectors are of distance one that's also called 
[29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1779) normalize what we can do and they actually are already but you can bring in a vector math and there's an operation for this it's called normalize what it does is it makes sure that if 
[29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1785) you have a vector pointing in this direction it maintains that Vector but it makes sure that it has a magnitude of one so this is a vector this is the normalized vector just make sure it has 
[29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1793) a length one but as you can see 0 01 obviously has a height of one cuz it's only on the z-axis so if we take this and then take a inverse cosine which is going to give us something kind of 
[30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1802) similar it's called R cosine but this is going to give us the angle this is exactly going to be black wherever that this is kind of pointing directly upward which we can actually isolate uh just 
[30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1811) like that so this is a good way to find where there's water cuz it always kind of goes to level to a thing uh but that that that's what you got now it turns out we don't actually care about this 
[30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1818) cuz we can still use this negative 1 to1 to define something but let's kind of stick with that so let's say that we have kind of like moss on the top and not moss on the bottom remember we do 
[30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1826) have this kind of like mix node we've talking about where we can make this the factor so I can make one of these one the other 1.5 and it will basically choose as we let me like decrease this 
[30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1834) value it'll basically choose what gets like what value depending on what is black and what is white but it turns out there's not just a mixed node but there's a mixed color which works 
[30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1841) exactly the same right so I can have one of these be red one of these be blue and now you can see we're kind of Shifting between them where in between we have this purple because this is not exactly 
[30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1849) black or white there's some gray in between just like real life but we could get rid of that if I say where's this greater than let's say .5 and now we have kind of like a sharp color if you 
[30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1855) want that and like I said colors and vectors basically the same thing they're a threedimensional vector which means if we have a mixed color so too can we use a mixed Vector where let's say one is 
[31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1863) red and one is blue so I'm just writing it explicitly and it gives us the same thing right I want this to be grass or Moss really so it should be kind of like a dark green up here and then on the 
[31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1871) bottom it can be kind of like a dirt color so kind of like a brown and this is kind of like our basic Moss setup that is responsive uh to the environment in fact if I add something with harsher 
[31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1880) edges you can see it's only on top B but as I Pebble it will kind of fade off as the vector aligns less and less with the Z up additionally we can get fancy and we'll come back to the Moss where 
[31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1889) instead of having this kind of like up Direction which by the way you can totally change so we can say what is facing the X Direction and now it's pointing this way you can do that plus y 
[31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1896) instead of something like that we can use the dot product to create something interesting where let's say that we have a camera that is facing our geometry so I'm just going to camera to view to face 
[31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1904) our Geo from the perspective of this camera I want to isolate the outline or roughly the outline of this object which is not information we actually get inherently without freestyle or 
[31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1913) something like this so how do we do that well in a case like this we know something is vaguely on the outline if it is facing away from us so this part of the sphere is facing this way whereas 
[32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1922) whereas the camera is kind of facing this way to the shading points in other words these two basically make a right angle and they're not facing each other at all on the other hand if we have a 
[32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1930) surface Point like this one right here that we're facing exactly uh a little hard to see with the threedimensional but these two vectors basically aligned they're kind of inverses but in a case 
[32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1937) like this we know what is and isn't facing us well how do we get this Vector from the camera to the surface well there is kind of a node for this but let's do it explicitly the way we get 
[32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1944) one vector from here to here is first of all we need to know the position of the ca and second of all we need to know the position of the surface point for the camera I'm going to do this explicitly 
[32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1952) for now so I'm going to combine XYZ and how do we know the position of the camera well it is written right here okay so I can copy this x value paste it in here same thing with the Y component 
[32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1960) and then finally the Z component so this Vector basically represents where the camera is it's not going to change no matter what direction we look at it from and additionally it's not going to 
[32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1968) change when we move our camera because then the location is changing and we haven't updated for that now the second thing we needed is the shading point where we're looking on the surface right 
[32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1975) so we need the position of points on the surface uh it turns out we don't don't have that in our coordinates although it is in a way a coordinate system you have to use that geometry node I was just 
[33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1982) talking about where we have all kinds of things like position that tells us the position of this which will change right uh depending on where the vertex positions are and to get the vector from 
[33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1989) the camera to the position all we have to do is subtract the two the reason for this is if we have a world origin where this is 0 00 0 the position represents the vector to get to the shading point 
[33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=1998) so this is position the camera Vector that we wrote out explicitly so this is C goes from the origin to the camera and if we take the position and subtract this camera in other words we're going 
[33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2007) negative so we go the position and then this way for the camera it's a little out of sight well this minus this is basically going to give us this direction which is parallel to this one 
[33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2015) so in other words what I want to do is I want to take the position we are going to then subtract away this camera Vector so this is basically going to give us the direction facing this but remember 
[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2023) for the dot product we want to always normalize cuz that will make the equation nicer and now for each point on the shading surface we know what direction the camera is facing to get 
[33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2030) there and we also know the normal of the surface so let's actually take the dot product let's compare how close these are to each other so I'm going to use a DOT product right here connect these and 
[33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2039) let's see what that gives us well it gives us basically something that is facing the camera okay so it's a little hard to tell but the outline of this is pretty much black we can make that more 
[34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2046) visible by let's say this is a thing between 1 and 1 so let's see where this is greater than some number and you can see we've essentially extracted out the outline right it turns out that there is 
[34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2053) a name for this this is called frenel which is basically the angle of where we're looking from compared to the surface normal so here is what fenel looks like so it looks something like 
[34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2061) this you can see it's dependent on the angle so this is a custom forel node where just like before we can use this as a mixing to kind of blend dirt and Moss together if you wanted to well 
[34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2069) you're seeing that this is working but it's kind of very boring and there's a lot of fading going on over here right there's no explicit moss and then no moss and we basically want to take this 
[34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2077) black and white and kind of compress them increase the contrast well here's a super useful node to kind of do this visually so we can take a color ramp node what this does is it takes a input 
[34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2085) and one of them is going to be black one of them is going to be white and you're going to see as I shift this it basically kind of recolors our thing we can actually invert this if we take both 
[34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2092) handles and flip them and most importantly for us is we can take these two and bring them very close together take kind of like a harsher Fallout Additionally you can kind of use this as 
[35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2100) a fancy mix note where the white can be matched kind of this dark green that we had before and the black can be kind of like a d color and just so you know there's a lot of ways to do this so let 
[35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2108) me just add RGB curves there's a lot of ways to Define this only kind of prerequisite is it's got to go from0 to one that's just what RGB curves like so I'm going to take map range we're going 
[35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2115) to go from negative 1 to one to 0 to one right we remap the range I'm going to connect this to the color so you're going to see we got something like that not much different than what we had 
[35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2122) before but now we can kind of sculpt out the look of this and get more uh custom kind of repetition kinds of things just like we could have done before and we did with the sonar like you can take a 
[35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2131) sign and do kind of like fancy things along this so let me multiply for a kind of more frequency thing okay let's get back to our Moss so we have this and we know how to isolate it thanks to the dot 
[35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2139) product but it's kind of very harsh right there's no kind of like noise or any kind of organic to that and the only way we could do this is if we modeled it ourselves so we have some up we have 
[35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2148) some down and it creates kind of this distorted thing which I want but what if I don't want to model and I just want that detail in the material well this is where noises come in so if you hit shift 
[35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2155) a to add a node you're going to notice that there's this this whole section called texture where we have noise texture magic texture all these you click one and basically what it shows 
[36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2162) you is a pattern that are dictated by different rules that have this kind of organic look to them so we have noise texture you kind of learn what these are about there's a wave texture wave just 
[36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2170) means repeat just like we did with the sine wave and just like we use this as a factor for our mixing so too can we use the noise texture which will now kind of fade between these note that the noise 
[36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2178) texture has this socket right here this Vector socket which means it relies on a coordinate system just like everything else does by default it uses something called generated coordinates we haven't 
[36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2186) talked about that but have talked about UV coordinates which are of course dependent on the UVS of our mesh either way we're for now going to use this default generated coordinate system just 
[36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2194) for your information we know normal represents the direction out of the surface we know UV is the UV texture what generated coordinates do is they basically take our mesh and make a 
[36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2203) bounding box they make the tiniest possible box that kind of well let me do this in three dimensions they make the tiniest possible box that contains this mesh and then for this Cube not a grid 
[36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2211) but a cube it imposes a x Direction just like our UV it imposes a y direction but it also imposes a z Direction so all of these are threedimensional but this one's really threedimensional right it 
[37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2220) cares about our X Y and Z which of course we can visualize by separating out the Spector so here is the X going from left to right along the x axis you can see that here here is the Y that 
[37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2228) goes this way and then finally we have the Z that goes vertically either way I can take our DOT product and kind of add influence from this by just multiplying them together so some sections get 
[37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2236) multiplied by a number close to zero so they get darker uh let's do it like this and now we have what we had before but with a bit uh with a bit of kind of detail so now when we view this our Moss 
[37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2246) looks a tiny bit better again we can kind of change the color ramp here but we still have kind of this super weird look where this brown is a single color and this green is essentially a single 
[37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2254) color and there's no kind of detail going on here but remember our noise texture has this black and white going everywhere which means we can incorporate that not only into our mask 
[37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2262) of where there's Moss but also into the color of the Moss and this is where we get into Color Math so remember we have value math the value is just a number and you can take two of these and 
[37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2270) multiply add whatever and then with vectors we have Vector math in the color world you could also use Vector math like we talked about but in the color world we use NYX color which which I 
[37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2277) showed you there's all these operations which you might be used to from Photoshop this is all like image editing photosho thing some of these make a lot of sense right we know what multiply 
[38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2285) means it's just multiply these two color vectors add means add their components but there's all kinds of weird one what I am going to do is in this mixed color for one of them I'm going to use our 
[38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2293) kind of green brown thing and right now just like our normal mix you can choose between selection a and selection B so selection B can be red and we can go between them what I want to do is 
[38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2301) instead of saying use one or the other and average them with mixing I want to say explicitly multiply so when we multiply this and this fact now represents how strong the multiplication 
[38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2309) is if I use one it's really just taking this and multiplying it by Red what that is going to give us is just the kind of darkish noisy red let's think about why that is well we had all this color that 
[38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2318) kind of takes up the full color spectrum of our threedimensional Vector space we'll call it red green blue but when we multiplied it by Red we essentially multiplied it by the vector one for red 
[38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2327) zero for green zero for blue we multiply these we get the red but then both of these over here are basically canceled out cuz green is multiplied by zero and so is blue so we don't want to do that 
[38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2335) we want to multiply in a way that doesn't isolate and specifically we want to use this noise texture so let's just drag this here and you can see we now took what we had and we multiplied it 
[39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2343) with the noise texture which we can make softer or harder our noise texture you might have noticed has all these numbers scale detail roughness whatever as kind of like a rule you can think of scale as 
[39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2351) basically kind of how densely Pat is this pattern so while scale increases you can see like the parts kind of get smaller so it's the inverse of what you think think of it as density let me 
[39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2359) bring that back down detail is basically how detailed I guess is this so this is before and after just adds a bit more roughness is basically kind of how spread out is this pattern and by the 
[39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2366) way all of this is easier to see if we use a color ramp not a mixed color but a color ramp so now if I increase the detail you can really see it increasing the detail and you can really see it 
[39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2374) increasing the roughness and if I now substitute out all our like noises with this new high contrast detailed noise you're going to see we get what we got before but with more detail so I'm going 
[39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2382) to increase the roughness just so it's a bit more distributed and I'm going to make the black less intense by bringing these kind of further apart so something like that it's actually looking quite 
[39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2389) similar to a Minecraft block because this is a way to kind of make that material and ultimately all of this is dependent on our nodes that we could change at any time remember uh dot 
[39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2398) product tells us what direction we're kind of comparing to so if I make this x now we have grass that grows sideways which is pretty cool in its own right let's do the Y component now it's going 
[40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2404) this way and while we have this material totally procedural so let's actually apply to a different object and make kind of like a minecrafty block so we use a cube we apply this material and 
[40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2412) now we get something like this now remember the reason that this is only on the top B is this is the only one that even remotely faces up all of them are basically perpendicular at a best but 
[40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2420) the rest of it totally applies right we had our high contrast noise texture and everything kind of maps the way we wanted to if you wanted to bleed off the edges a quick way to do that is we just 
[40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2427) add a bit of a bevel and now it kind of bleeds a bit further down cuz our surface normals are aligned and then a little less aligned and then barely aligned and then not at all and you 
[40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2435) could get fancy where you can model you know as you go you can see it kind of updates where the dirt should and shouldn't be I mean look I can inset this and then maybe extrude a block over 
[40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2442) here that knows it should have grass and it does a bit of a fall off by the way the last thing I'll say here before we wrap up this section is you might have noticed that this noise basically this 
[40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2449) black Runge as we kind of stretch it out this way it kind of stretches out our texture right you can kind of tell it's like being stretched this way I can make it even more stream and now look at that 
[40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2458) okay so one kind of issue with the generated coordinate system is remember the way generated coordinates work is they create a bounding box for our mesh and three dimensions but if one of these 
[41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2466) axes is super long like this Y axis our bounding box which always goes from 0 to one on each axis has y go from 0 to 1 over a very big distance which creates that stretching one easy solution to 
[41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2476) this is like generated coordinates there's something called object coordinates they're actually very similar although instead of using a bounding box all it really cares about 
[41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2483) is kind of the origin of our mesh and then how far away each point is which means we can substitute this in as object coordinates and view it and now we don't have any stretching no matter 
[41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2492) how we modify the geometry while object coordinates doesn't care about edit mode which is quite nice you can see it kind of like changes with our mesh it does actually care about object transform so 
[41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2500) if I scale it this way you can see it still does our stretching which we don't want you can see right here we have this scaling of eight that is fixed by applying this scale so contr a apply 
[41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2507) scale and now we're all good so now we've talked about different coordinate systems and how to make something more complicated okay we're back with part three this time we're going to be 
[41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2514) talking about bsdf which is actually how you use this thing in Ean cycle so let's get to it so what is a bsdf well it kind of stands for like by directional surface dire it doesn't really matter 
[42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2524) what it means but what it is is it's basically a material it's basically a Shader that responds to lighting remember if I go to the shading workspace and just kind of view our 
[42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2532) render and I get rid of this bsdf and just do the kinds of things we've been doing so let's make this white it doesn't actually respond to light because why would it it's just a value 
[42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2540) of one it doesn't care about the context of the scene but there's this whole class of nodes called shaders and most of these are blah blah blah bsdf and these are basically know somebody else 
[42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2548) made that response to light there's all kinds usually the simplest is considered diffus bsdf it's pretty simple you pick the color which we know is a threedimensional vector you pick the 
[42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2556) roughness which is basically how shiny it is so let's switch over to Cycles it's kind of subtle but you'll see the difference as we increase the roughness right it doesn't reflect the light as 
[42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2563) much and it is more green than it was before but just so we understand what's going on let's make a dsdf ourselves so let's make the same kind of thing so we know RGB lets us pick a threedimensional 
[42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2572) vector so here we have green but of course this doesn't respond to lighting it's kind of like emissive uh the Shadows don't count we only care about what's on the surface well to actually 
[43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2580) shade this what do we know about lights if the surface is kind of pointing towards the light source and of course we're talking about surface normals in this context like we talked about if it 
[43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2588) is facing the light it should be brighter than something like over here that is not facing the light and this kind of obscured which of course we know how to do as a DOT product so the first 
[43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2597) thing we need is we are going to execute we're not going to kill but we're going to execute a DOT product the first of which of course is our normal coordinates we talked about this this 
[43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2604) gives us the vector at every you know surface point every face that tells us which way it is facing and the other thing we care about is the direction from surface point to the light we 
[43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2613) basically calculated this before when we were treating this as a camera so let's do it again we care about the position of the shading point so here we have the position and second of all we care about 
[43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2621) the location of the light and this is something we subtract one from the other in this case I want a vector that points towards the light so we're actually going to have position be the second 
[43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2629) socket and then for the first socket we care about the position of the light for now we are just going to copy it manually but then I'll show you how we can like avoid this and this is our Z 
[43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2637) component that again gives us a vector that is physici dependent but as we know we want to normalize this Vector before it goes into the dot product just so we get good cosine of AA properties and the 
[44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2645) length is one so I'm going to normalize and of course you can also normalize your normal coordinates but they're actually already normalized it's in the name so I'm going to take the dot 
[44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2653) product of these and let's view it and you can see this gives us pretty much exactly what we want this face that is not facing the light is in darkness and the faces that are facing the light you 
[44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2661) know start doing what they're supposed to when we rotate this object you're going to see the lighting doesn't update because it actually cares about the position of every text that doesn't 
[44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2667) technically change when you do an object transform so if I go to edit mode and now rotate you're going to see the lighting updates the way you would expect it to nice and in Shadow uh let's 
[44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2675) say we move our light around it doesn't do anything except for the uh Shadow which we can actually get rid of this plane so we can see what's going on here we want this to actually know where the 
[44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2682) light is as it's updating which means we can't just have a static Vector instead I can look at this x component and see how it's updating by right clicking we say copy is a new driver and then in the 
[44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2692) material for the X components all you have to do is paste the driver so what you're going to see is right now it's 2. .4 but as I move the light around there's now something happening now it's 
[45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2700) 1.6 it only updates the X component so as you expect we right click copy as a new driver what a driver basically means is it references one piece of data to update another piece of data and now 
[45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2709) we've actually done everything we need of course it looks a little janky but we've done everything we need uh technically to make a lighting setup of course this only works with a single 
[45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2717) light you'd have to add multiple light sources uh but it's not too bad so you can think of this as in Full Exposure until we darken and use our lighting and everything so I'm going to mix color I'm 
[45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2725) going to multiply our DOT product so full strength we are going to multiply and now you can see it's the same thing as before uh but it darkens and technically you might see here if you 
[45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2734) kind of look it actually has kind of a hot spot that gets kind of weaker radially as it goes outwards this of course makes sense because this whole face does have the same surface normal 
[45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2743) at every shading point however the direction to the lights basically changes depending where we are which means that the dot product effectively changes so we get that for free now 
[45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2751) another thing you're going to notice is if I keep this kind of in the same direction let's just do it upwards you're going to notice that yes it has the hot spot and everything but the 
[45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2758) lights or the lighting basically doesn't get weaker I can bring this infinitely high and it's always going to be basically exposed what we know is as this distance between the Surface point 
[46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2767) or the shading points and the light Grows Right so now it's bigger uh it should get dimmer and that is proportional to an inverse Square so you can think of the light or the strength 
[46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2775) of the light to be a function of one over the distance between the two squared what that basically means is if we have a height here it has some strength but if I now double this so now 
[46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2784) it's two times as tall it's not going to get half as weak it's actually going to get four times as we cuz we have that inverse Square this is because light basically emits in spheres the surface 
[46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2792) area of which is a function of a square doesn't really matter but what does matter is I care about the distance between these and we've already actually calculated distance remember we had the 
[46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2799) square root of x^2 plus y^ s and all this which is the way to do it but now we know what's going on so I'm going to give you a bit of a secret in the vector math all along there is a distance 
[46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2808) function that does this for you you give two vectors it will tell you the distance sorry for not telling you so our first input is the position this is what I care about and our second input 
[46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2816) is going to be this updated position of the light and this will give us the distance however you're going to see that we wrote this Vector in here so we can't really bring it over here like we 
[47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2824) didn't Outsource it bit of an oversight but if you think about it the distance between these is the same as saying look at the vector that points from one to another and then give me the magnetude 
[47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2833) how long is that Vector what that means is instead of the distance function which totally works I can take this Vector that is not normalized it actually has a length that isn't one 
[47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2841) necessarily and I now calculate the length of the vector so these are kind of related ideas so if I view this what you're going to see is as I bring the light it's going to get darker and you 
[47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2849) know vice versa but this is a inverse Square relationship in other words it should get dimmer as I go further away not the opposite so I'm going to take the reciprocal you can do that by 
[47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2858) dividing one over either way you're going to see it's pretty bright here and as I move it away it gets pretty dim but it does that in some way like inverse linearly so we take a power of two and 
[47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2867) now it's an inverse square and you're going to see the darkening this actually looks like what you're kind of used to this basically distance function doesn't account for what uh faces are facing 
[47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2876) away from the light so things can be exposed that aren't supposed to be as you might expect all I need is both of these pieces of information so I multiply them together and now we don't 
[48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2883) only have this nice uh strength of Whiting but also kind of the uh faces that are obscured this is what we pipe into our green mixer and now we have something like this and you might be 
[48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2893) thinking how do I make this light stronger because if I increase the power or decrease it it actually doesn't do anything because we made our own bsdf in away that doesn't actually look at that 
[48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2901) data so if you think about it all we have to do is take this light intensity or kind of this inverse distance and we take it and we multiply it by some number If I multiply it by 10 it's going 
[48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2910) to be 10 times as strong just like before if you want the actual settings for this we can take the power and create a driver so now it's at a value of a th000 I'm going to paste this into 
[48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2919) our multiplication of course this is going to be super bright cuz it's taking values like a th000 you have to get pretty far away to see what's going on so because we're wanting this to be like 
[48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2926) somewhere between 1 and 10 you can take this driver and let's go to edit mode you can actually do a division or an expression by saying let's do a scripted expression so right now it's taking the 
[48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2935) energy of the light which it knows what that is I'm going to take it and divide it by let's say 100 so it's still dependent on this right you can see it's updating but um it's not as intense 
[49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2943) another way to think about this is let's actually make the power super low let's set it equal to one and then for this edit driver we no longer need this expression it can just be the energy and 
[49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2951) this is kind of a more sensical way to do it anyhow because our numbers are going to be small anyway so let's try it on a sphere let's make that a bit bigger now you can see we have a bit of a 
[49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2959) smoother situation and you're actually seeing this fac setting where you can see every single face and that is of course because our normals that are you know used to calculate the dot product 
[49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2968) uh those are kind of quantized where we can shade smooth and now they're no longer quantized in the worst case scenario this unlit section is basically black no light is reaching it which of 
[49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2976) course isn't realistic when we have this gray world it would be realistic if I kind of darken the background right like this is what you'd see in something like space let me actually save this bad boy 
[49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2984) it is what you would see in space but our background is gray so there should be some ambient light so this is the concept when you have diffuse you have directional lighting which of course we 
[49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=2992) have right here but you should also have ambient lighting we just add a bit and of course if I'm saying that we are to add a bit we can do that so I guess what we can do is after the stop product I 
[50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3001) don't know if this is precise but after it we multiply and all this I can just add a tiny bit of a boost so you can see here we're increasing our ambient lighting let's set that to point two and 
[50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3009) now yes um there's a bit of a background thing but we can actually you know I don't know we we we can see what's going on here uh we do have all of this and it does seem to have lighting and 
[50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3017) everything we'd expect but it's still a little hard to see the form of this it actually looks like a flat uh Circle in this case which might be accurate with the lighting but I just want to see a 
[50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3025) bit of a rim light remember we did make a function that will exactly tell us the outline or what we call the Fel this time because I don't want to do it again with the camera and all this remember 
[50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3034) how we did it with the dot product we basically Swap this out for a camera and then use inverse Square uh we are now free I'm claiming to use the frel node okay we've done it already it's good 
[50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3042) enough and I'm going to have this like Fel outline be brighter on the edges which it is so you can either do this additive or as a multiplication I am going to do it I'm going to do it as a 
[50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3051) addition so we have our ambient light and then further I'm going to add this Fel uh which might be a bit intense we can change it later but now we can actually see the form of this quite well 
[51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3060) you might argue that this seel should also be a function of the dot product let me think about this if we wanted that what we can do is instead of adding after the fact we can take this Fel and 
[51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3068) add before the dot product so it's affected by it I don't know how I feel about that it definitely adds something but for my purposes I'm not saying this is physically accurate but for my 
[51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3076) purposes I'm going to add it after and we can play with something called the index of refraction basically you can think of it as the harshness of this situation there's a technical definition 
[51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3084) of how much it bends light and all this and I'm going to make it a little intense by multiplying R forel by a tiny number like let's say. 3 now this technically isn't enough logic to do 
[51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3092) every kind of scenario so if I have a tus I shade smooth uh you can totally tell it's a Taurus however however you're going to notice something weird if I put this light over here indeed 
[51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3100) this section isn't Shadow cuz it's facing away from the light but let me do this kind of perfectly the perfect scenario so this section is lit you're going to notice that this section is 
[51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3108) also lit which if you think about it doesn't really makes sense because the light Ray shoots in this direction it then hits this shading point and makes it a certain brightness uh but then if 
[51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3116) this Ray was to continue and hit this shading Point uh it's already been obstructed right we have no information that says you've already intersected uh the mesh essentially and this with this 
[52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3125) idea I'm describing is actually the idea of Shadows like light intersecting surfaces not just kind of like this dot product looking thing but actual Shadows uh we're going to need to have kind of 
[52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3133) this Collision system that tells us did we intersect something now this is kind of hard to do by itself because we don't have information about intersection right I can start at a point and go 
[52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3142) towards the direction of the light but how would I even know if I even intersect did at any point well it turns out there's many ways to do this with SDF and something called aray marching 
[52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3150) but for the purposes of this uh tutorial we're not going to do it because the way I know how to do it is with a ray marching or Ray tracing and that takes a while to implement so for this plane I'm 
[52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3159) going to shift click contrl l link materials now both of these kind of have this situation and our scene uh can be properly lit whereas we go further away it kind of gets darker I think our 
[52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3167) ambient light is definitely a bit strong so let me make it like five times weaker you could also make it a function of this kind of like inverse square with the strength thing so you can multiply 
[52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3175) it like this and now the for now is definitely there you can tell that there's a difference but it does kind of go away at a certain point I think this is more physically accurate in my mind 
[53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3182) so we created a bsdf beautiful it isn't you know fully featured like the diffuse bsdf is Right diffuse bsdf has Shadows or it works with shadows it also has roughness and it has something called 
[53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3193) normals which we'll talk about by default it actually uses the normal coordinates that you're used to so if I type in coordinates use normal it doesn't change anything but the moment I 
[53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3200) modify these coordinates like I shift it like this you can see it does lighting stuff so if we were to affect the normals it affects kind of the shading and this isn't surprising because if we 
[53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3208) take our normal coordinates here in our custom setup and let's do a vector addition we also kind of get this weird effect so it turns out if we modify our normals just a little we can get kind of 
[53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3217) cool shading effects but we'll go back to that now instead of this green let's do something more interesting remember we talked about different kinds of textures like a noise texture for 
[53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3225) example that has this three-dimensionality to it so let's actually use object coordinates to prevent stretching if you're seeing that this is denser here than on the grid the 
[53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3233) density of the noise we talked about how this doesn't like necessarily change with a scaling so contr a ay scale and now it works I'm going to connect this instead of our green and now we view it 
[54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3243) and we have still our lighting set up but with a bit of noise and let's you know let's also make it green so just like before I can multiply these two together uh set it to multiplication I 
[54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3252) don't think the order matters and now we have green with a tiny bit of grunge that I can make more detailed maybe a bit rougher and now we have the impression of maybe grass or something 
[54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3261) like that uh before we wrap up here let's actually use some of this logic we made to uh create a nice little bsdf node dress so what I want control over is I want to keep the normals over here 
[54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3271) I want to keep the color stuff over here I guess so we can choose the color and lastly we like our ambient lighting where we can choose that with a single number uh with a value that's kind of 
[54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3280) the overall brightness of the scene this is also something I want to control and everything else yeah the rest we can throw into a group so select all contrl G and now we've reduced our whole setup 
[54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3288) to basically three inputs we can uh totally name these so Hit N for the panel our Vector thing is really the normal our a is basically the color and then this you can think of as ambient 
[54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3299) light this outputs not technically but we'll call it a BSD so if at any point I was to change the color it does that if I change the ambient light it does that and if I modify the normals it will 
[55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3310) modify the normals I'm going to let's just use no no no let's keep it like this I'm just going to pack this into a little section for our color take this shift p for panel I think it stands for 
[55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3318) and connect that to the color okay I think we'll call it a wrap here I definitely think that's good enough for this part I'm happy with this by the way little tip to wrap up here if you want 
[55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3327) different colors or whatever for different objects it turns out that even with a single material right so I don't need to duplicate this material and for this one make it red and all this it 
[55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3335) turns out with a single material it knows which object is which by adding a maybe the geometry node has this so remember we use geometry node for the position here oh by the way I got to 
[55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3344) make sure I didn't duplicate this so now this should show everywhere uh we have the position but it also has other things like the normal the tangent but what we care about is there's something 
[55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3352) called random per Island little hard to tell but you're going to see this one's Gray as this one is white and it turns out that each island so I'm just going to kind of duplicate this here each 
[56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3361) island each separate piece of geometry it generates a random number between zero and one uh to distinguish them another way to do this if you don't want the island situation which doesn't 
[56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3369) necessarily work with duplicating the same object cuz it basically has the same island there's also a node called object info whereas this gives us a per shading Point thing for different 
[56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3377) objects object info just cares about the objects themselves so if I look at location I can have one object moving and it's the same for the entire object I can extract data like the objects not 
[56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3386) object and index but I guess we'll just use random and this also gives us a random number but now it works with this which is actually preferable for us and if I want to generate different colors 
[56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3394) with this so now we're introducing new notes we could either I mean we could just do something like combine XYZ where this is kind of the strength of the red so you can see these have different 
[56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3402) amounts of red but if I want to actually randomize the color here uh we talked about different kinds of noises right or different kinds of textures we have noise texture we have wave texture 
[56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3410) here's an interesting one there's something called White Noise White Noise kind of looks like this I think by default it uses generated coordinates you're actually not going to be able uh 
[56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3418) to tell what this does is it's basically like TV static every shading Point even ones infinite asally close to each other get a random number between zero and one which means no matter how much you zoom 
[57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3426) in it's basically going to look gray cuz it averages out visually but it turns out that you can also do this with color so you can get choma noise and to me this is important because instead of 
[57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3435) using generated coordinates we can use a single Vector right or a single number uh to determine this let's actually use a single number and you're going to see as I change this number it's going to 
[57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3443) give the same color to everything because our white noise is a valuating at a single Vector only at 3.07 3.07 3.07 and because that's the same everywhere it's going to give the same 
[57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3452) random number everywhere instead of using something like uh I don't know position coordinates where you can see each shading point is different meaning that if I have different random values I 
[57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3460) can use this as the vector uh to give different you know luminances but more importantly different colors okay and this is going to vary for every single object and by the way if you want to 
[57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3469) alter this all you need to do is just offset your random a bit and each one's going to generate a different color so let's say instead of our green I connect this over here I view our bsdf and now 
[57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3479) we have I don't know this looks more like a old school uh Toy Story scene to me panel which by the way uh in the end menu you can give it a name so I'm going to call it color and that shows up this 
[58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3488) is our uh kind of color thing by the way I probably should have closed these windows I guess you can make this four-dimensional which gives it a w slider think of it as a randomization 
[58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3495) slider it's a four dimensional noise kind of complicated more simply we can just vary our input uh right here to change the color and this works with various objects if I give them the same 
[58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3503) materials I'm going to put a sphere here maybe I'll put a cube over here make sure to contr L link the materials and now we have I mean it's way more complicated than what we had before I'll 
[58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3513) say that okay so in this part we created light itself I guess let's do another part are we going to keep going I don't know so I'm pretty sure this is going to be the last part we'll see if I'm 
[58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3520) inspired to do more so we have our like fake bsdf and I want to take it one step further and add kind of like custom normal mapping I'll tell you what that means right now so we have our custom 
[58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3529) bsdf which is starting to look pretty similar to the diffuse bsdf so here you can see the diffus bsdf it looks a lot nicer cuz there's shadow and all this but what I want to emphasize is for 
[58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3538) color uh we have color uh we actually have ambient lighting which diffuse bsdf doesn't and we have a normal socket which I want to modify we don't have roughness but we'll live with it what is 
[59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3547) special about this normal socket which is actually identical uh to the one we made is it inspires the idea of using custom normals not just the ones you get so let me show you what that means 
[59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3556) imagine that we use the same color as before so we have our like same setup over here I'm going to make the light a bit stronger cuz it's using the actual power you're going to notice that this 
[59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3563) looks pretty plain right like it has all this noise but it's as if it's a perfectly flat surface but there's no like texture or like detail or grunge in the actual normal mapping what I mean by 
[59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3573) this is if I look at the normal coordinate it's just blue because it is facing directly upward so Z component is One X and Y are suppressed well what I can do here is use this kind of like 
[59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3582) noise texture from before to actually create uh more normal coordinates I'm just going to use a node we haven't talked about yet we're actually going to make this ourselves it's called The Bump 
[59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3589) node it converts like value information into normal information and I'm just going to connect this into the normal socket and you can see all of the sudden all we did is we changed the normals you 
[59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3597) can see that there's actual like texture here let me make this even stronger there's actual like kind of like textural something to this right so this is without it's just kind of like 
[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3605) perfectly flat and then this is with now while our plane is in reality perfectly flat which means from the side view it basically looks like this and has a normal Direction this way what I want to 
[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3614) kind of fake is let's say that this surface is a tiny bit Rocky like kind of microscopically uh detailed the difference in this case is our normals are no longer just straight up in fact 
[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3624) in this section it's straight up in this section it's pointed a little this way pointed a little this way going a bit up and as we remember we're using the dot product as compared to the direction of 
[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3633) the light to judge kind of the darkness or shading of every single point which is going to look different if we modify kind of the height or the normals rather than just using the flat surface in 
[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3642) other words if I have a height map that basically defines how rocky I want the surface to be we need a converter that goes from height information to normal information again extracting these 
[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3651) vectors that aren't really there well the theory of this is actually quite simple right if I'm at the peak of this in other words it's kind of flat the way I know it's flat is what I'm doing in my 
[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3659) brain is I'm imagining this tangent line that's just tangent it's right on the surface and if I take this tangent kind of Direction and rotate it by 90Â° we have the normal similarly if I have a 
[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3669) point that's on a bit of a slant I imagine this kind of tangent line I you know have this Vector I rotate it by 90Â° and then I have this in other words to extract the normal Vector in a case this 
[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3678) two-dimensional case all I need to know is basically kind of this tangent line which will give us the normal now in three dimensions it gets a bit more complicated right so instead of like you 
[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3686) know a two-dimensional Rocky surface it's kind of so here I'm trying to draw a threedimensional hill it doesn't really translate but here the surface is threedimensional so instead of a tangent 
[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3693) line we have tangent planes that are facing different directions each with their own uh normal Vector which means instead of getting kind of like a simple slope of a line we kind of need the 
[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3702) slope in a sense of the surface which actually generalizes quite nicely in the two-dimensional case the way I actually calculate or approximate this tent is if I have this kind of like height map like 
[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3712) I know what this hill is I know the slope of this tangent by looking at rise over run you might remember that so we have y That's The Rise ID X is equal to the slope or at least this is a 
[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3722) approximation because what we need to do is have this rise over run sampled at tinier and tinier intervals closer to our point right because if we have a point like this that exists somewhere on 
[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3732) the x-axis so we have an x value right here I'm going to sample a bit to the left and maybe a bit to the right so I give a bit of a nudge on the x-axis so let's say we're now evaluating right 
[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3741) here we look at the rise the difference and the height between these points and how much we traversed on the X so you can think of this as X plus a tiny infinitesimal kind of like Delta so this 
[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3750) will give a pretty good approximation instead of like let's say we did a big shift in X so this is X Plus like a big Delta in that case I'm like evaluating over here and then the rise over the Run 
[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3761) kind of represents a very light different slope so two in uh three dimensions we have a bit more leeway so I can go in this direction I can go in this direction there's a lot of options 
[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3769) all I need to do is sample the X and the y direction and kind of combine them so I go a bit on the x axis and then I sample and I look at that two dimensional slope rise over run and then 
[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3778) I also sample let's say the orthogonal like in a different dimension I then say combine these to create the threedimensional slope or the tangent plane that then defines a normal in 
[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3788) other words instead of a extra evaluation I have to do an extra two evaluations so for this I'm actually going to take my noise texture nodes and just put them over here for now we're 
[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3795) we're going to use the original but uh for now I just want like to illustrate this more simply this noise texture you can think of as a height map and you're thinking how is that height it's just 
[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3802) kind of the splotchy thing well if I make this higher contrast you'll be able to see you can think of black areas as being on the surface and the more white it is so like a white point over here 
[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3810) represents something that's higher up in other words if I have a rocky surface like this this section right here is going to be black with a value of zero this section right here is going to be 
[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3817) 0.5 and as we go higher and more white it eventually maxes out at a height of one so if I want to sample this at two different spots I guess yeah one on the X and one on the Y plus the original so 
[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3827) three spots all I need to do is I take my coordinate system and say nudge it a little right so instead of our default coordinate system I can add a tiny bit on the X right like 2 you can see what 
[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3836) this effectively does is it like moves our height map which makes sense cuz I want to sample just a bit to the side so I need to know what that is so let's say I shift this by 0.1 so this is without 
[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3845) and this is with just a bit of a nudge if I want to know the rise over the Run we can figure out what the rise is by evaluating again so this is our original this is our shifted the rise is the 
[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3854) difference between the heights right like how high up did we go so I subtract these and then the run is how much I nudged it remember our slope is the change of height over the change of how 
[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3863) much we nudged it in this case we nudged it by 0.1 so literally take this and divide it by 0.1 and the this piece of color that you're seeing here basically represents how much the surface is 
[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3872) changing on the x-axis so instead of going like 0.1 for example I want to explicitly say uh what do we go like 0.1 2 05 whatever it is we divide by this number so I'm going to divide by two so 
[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3881) now this is going to be a bit more accurate divide by two a bit more accurate and you really want this to be tiny so saying .001 uh which is what is actually 
[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3889) written here even though you can't see it is better than 0.1 you're going to see these look pretty similar um but one kind of has more accurate data so two can we do this nudge on the Y AIS so all 
[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3899) I'm going to do oh by the way this might be responsible for the change make sure you're using object coordinates um not necessarily because they're object coordinates but because we Ed them here 
[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3906) so if you use generated use generated for both and vice versa actually this looks a lot more sensical it looks a lot more sharp you can almost imagine the surface next I'm going to do the exact 
[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3914) same thing so I'm going to take my object coordinates I'm going to offset them by basically the same thing so I have a custom Vector uh but this time instead of nudging on the X I'm going to 
[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3922) take the same number I want to Nudge by the same amount so that they're um terms of ratio kind of like equal to each other in a way doesn't matter I'm going to take this number and this time shove 
[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3930) it on the Y AIS okay so instead of X we're doing Y which means we again have our original sample and our shifted y sample you can barely tell the difference cuz they're barely uh 
[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3938) different I'm going to subtract the two so we are comparing them and then did we do everything correct over here I believe so and we need to divide by this very tiny number to kind of normalize 
[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3947) this and now you can see we kind of have this rough Direction Let's actually view it from the top uh in this y so you can almost see it's in this axis and then X is the other like I said if you combine 
[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3955) these contribution so this is basically a uh a change of X in terms of slope and this is a change of Y we combine these into a single Vector this is the X component this is the Y component to get 
[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3965) something that's kind of like a normal map uh really this is the difference of what we had uh to get the actual normals you need to add the original contribution so it's pointing up and 
[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3974) then we added a bit of variation so you said Z equal to 1 and this is the actual normal map let's see if it's identical to the way um bump node does it so I plug this into the height you can see it 
[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3983) looks basically the same if you do not want to add the Z component which by the way is different depending on which way we angled the surface instead it would make sense to use this difference and 
[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=3992) then add our original uh normal so we have what it was before plus uh our contribution which updates depending on the uh Direction now technically we do live in a three-dimensional World which 
[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4003) means yes we can kind of approximate this normal using X and Y and all this but that isn't accurate in any case where like this isn't like perfectly flat and we're doing a height right if 
[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4013) we have a sphere some tangent planes are pointing upwards but some of them are pointing downwards so you kind of have to account for all of these so there is a sense in which you also want to do 
[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4023) another evaluation so now we're doing four total evaluations and we do need to copy this noise texture each time or whatever hype map you have you can't just put it all in one vector the cost 
[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4030) of doing a normal is just doing extra evaluations so this is going to be our object coordinates you know the drill plus an offset of this number on the z-axis I subtract our new contribution 
[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4040) minus the original I take this bad boy and I divide it by our tiny number which in the case of it pointing straight up you can expect is just going to be I guess noise texture is threedimensional 
[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4050) in a sense so you wouldn't really see this in like a two-dimensional image uh but in this case there is a change of like Z component which uh will update depending on the direction of the 
[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4058) Surface by the way you can argue that we want to like make sure these are all in the same order so for example we do a shift in x minus the original in this case we want to do a shift in Y which is 
[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4067) this one so we need to flip it minus the original and then in this case we have a shift of Z minus the original basically as long as you're consistent you'll be pretty good plus or minus a minus sign 
[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4075) so we have our X component we have our y component and now we have our Z component that gives us the total offset that again we can just add our uh normal uh two so make sure we have our normal 
[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4085) coordinates and this is basically uh what is going on here uh this whole nonsense we want to use for the dot product basically so because this is a monstrosity we can take this and 
[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4096) actually put it in a single node of course we might change the hyp map later but whatever so I'm going to combine all of this nonsense all of it except for maybe this like 0.001 that I guess I do 
[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4107) want to like change later so I'm going to take all of this plus this plus the coordinates Control G and all of that nonsense reduces to something that is actually manageable the reason that node 
[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4116) by the way is called bump is we are bumping we are shifting the sorry uh we are shifting the surface and we don't actually need our original normal coordinates cuz we added them inside of 
[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4124) here okay what is the point of all this the point is now we have our bsdf I told you we'd go back to this it's using normal normal coordinates but here I have a different one where I can plug it 
[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4134) in and now you can tell it's a bit intense but it's actually responding in a way that looks you know accurate right so now the question is how do we take this and make it less intense well we 
[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4142) always want to have our original normal coordinates plus our calculation but our calculation of adding in these fake normals can be not as intense less contribution in other words you take 
[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4151) this and you multiply it by a tiny number you can think of it as just multiplying it again you can use a value here by 0.1 so here you can see instead of one we use .1 and it's much softer 
[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4160) another way to do this by the way that's more intuitive is you use scale this is identical to multiplying by value except this time the value is explicitly here and we now have the luxury of making 
[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4169) that a parameter where the first one is the distance of sampling and the second one is the strength of the uh normals now we didn't do all this work just to have a plane right we want to have the 
[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4177) uh threedimensional case so let's bring back our objects here so remember we had this setup where it picks the color randomly and because they're all using the same material they all have that 
[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4185) noise texture and you can see it's looking much more realistic than before right it's capturing like more uh information in a sense and this is kind of how like rendering works or how B DFS 
[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4195) work we just made our own and the name of the game is basically swapping out our height map which right now we're using this noise texture for whatever it is we want okay um because there 
[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4204) actually is a bump node that the difference between these two or we want the real bump node actually the one we made is the real one but uh the reason we want this uh bump node is instead of 
[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4213) like putting in this noise texture or whatever height map four times if I want to change it I need to change it four times this bump uh thing basically does that for us okay so I'm going to keep 
[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4221) this off to the side it is useful but I'm going to use the standard now that we know how to make it I feel like we've earned it so now I plug this into the normal coordinates and right now it's 
[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4228) just using the normal by default it looks like this isn't connected to anything but it is just using the normal coordinates instead I'm going to use this like noise texture for example as 
[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4237) the height it's literally called height cuz it's a height map and now we have basically the same thing where we control the strength we we just made this ourselves uh it happens and I guess 
[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4243) in this case uh distance is kind of inversely proportional to what we did either way we now have a bump which by the way you can inverts so instead of popping outwards uh it goes inwards kind 
[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4251) of like reversing the vector for the dot product doesn't really matter by the way I should mention ideally we do like vectors normalized to get them to work the way we want to in terms of the dot 
[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4261) product so you do want to make sure I guess at the end of this you have your normal plus the contribution just take it and normalize it so it has a magnitude of one this is important 
[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4267) because our bsdf calculates a DOT product and doesn't do the normalization uh in there so we'll do it in the other one either way we now have the luxury of swapping our hype map so let's do 
[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4277) something different like a wave texture that looks like this you plug in either the color or the factor I believe if you do the color it will just take the red or X component I'm going to plug this 
[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4284) into the it looks pretty much what you expect it to look like and now you can see it's as if we actually modeled ridges into our surface that that is normal mapping which is kind of like the 
[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4293) big piece of uh kind of like realistic rendering here and in a way you can think of roughness or how shiny a surface is not technically but kind of as kind of like inversely proportional 
[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4302) uh to our strength so as the strength is Big not very rough or sorry extremely rough um like there's not much reflectivity is what I meant and then as this goes down you can think of this as 
[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4311) kind of more reflective Technically when you have Reflections you have a light Ray hitting the surface it looks at the normal and then goes this way and then goes this way and sees what it's 
[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4319) actually reflecting so like a mirror it would have a bit of red a bit of whatever uh we're not doing that in the same way that we are not doing Shadows here you have your diffuse bsdf if you 
[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4327) get rid of the Shadows there's actually not much of a difference so for our objects in visibility I can actually disable Shadows so that we get you know pretty much what we have set up over 
[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4336) here so I'm getting rid of Shadows and now you can see the diffuse bsdf in action compared to our custom bsdf where I have to lower the strength of this which looks pretty similar in my opinion 
[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4346) again the difference is it has like reflectivity kind of with the roughness and it has Global illumination where you know this point in some sense effects to this point cuz light can bounce and do 
[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4354) all kinds of things but that is our custom bsdf okay I decided we're doing another one this is the final part of the series cuz I think I've taken you from Zero to Hero right there's more 
[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4362) with image textures and all this but this is kind of the basics of how things work in this part I I mentioned reflectivity and kind of light bounces and all that we're not going to do light 
[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4369) bounces but I am going to kind of do reflectivity for you guys so at the moment our environment or we call it the world is basically gray right there's not much to reflect and by the way uh we 
[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4379) can totally change this either in the world parameters of course this isn't going to affect anything because uh we want this to proportionally affect our like ambient light but whatever uh it 
[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4388) turns out that you can do more than just pick a color right you can change it for all kinds of things what you want to do is in the world settings you can pick your own uh HD which is basically an 
[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4396) image that represents the spherical uh environment if you have a no Wrangler you can hit contrl T it adds all these nodes we basically know what these do we know what generated coordinates are we 
[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4403) know what a texture is although this time it's not noise or wave we just pick our own image from our computer and the mapping we didn't really talk about but you can think of this as kind of off 
[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4411) setting so for location uh which is really the only one we talked about it's the same as just offsetting with a vector so uh with a environment texture what I can do is I can load a hdri that 
[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4420) I downloaded from the uh internet this is our environment again it's not going to be reflected whether we have e or Cycles like it's just not going to show up but for now I don't want to see that 
[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4429) we might turn it on later I want this to kind of affect what we see you know over here so back into to Object Land where we're dealing with our material we somehow need somehow need so like let's 
[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4439) say we have a reflection over here we're viewing from the camera so we are looking in from the camera we have a ray from the camera going here it's going to reflect kind of like infinitely into the 
[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4448) distance until it hits kind of like our environment our scene and that tells us what it should be reflecting well we need a way to kind of reflect things and we can totally do this ourselves right 
[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4456) we know how to calculate a vector coming from the camera we actually did this ourselves and it turns out there actually is a node for this it's called Uh incoming cuz this is the vector that 
[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4463) is incoming it is coming towards the camera it changes based on perspective and you can totally reflect by saying take the incoming Vector look at the surface normal and just kind of reflect 
[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4473) off that direction like bouncing off a wall uh we can totally do that and I guess let me just show you how you would do that so we have our incoming we have our normal and just like we had cool 
[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4480) operations with our DOT product so to can we take Vector math and look at our options and we have reflect refract face forwards we care about reflecting so if this is what I think it is we take the 
[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4489) incoming Vector we're looking at the surface and then reflecting it off of the direction of the surface so off of the normal this is going to give us a coordinate system that looks like this 
[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4497) main takeaway is that it is view dependent right in this case it's going to be one color because we are you know reflecting off of something that has a consistent normal whereas if I was to 
[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4506) kind of bevel this you're going to see the kind of changes okay in a way we've created what you can consider to be a reflection coordinate system it just samples off into the distance as always 
[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4514) there is a pre-established thing for this cuz this turns out to be quite useful so if I look at my not normal not UV not object but reflection coordinates they're not necessarily going to be 
[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4523) exactly the same but you can see it does kind of a similar thing so this is our custom reflection if anything it looks the same minus the black here I think the main difference here is technically 
[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4532) so we know how to make a ray going from the camera to the surface I said that there's something called incoming I think what it is technically is it is that but it is the inverse right so if I 
[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4540) have a camera here casting array onto the surface uh this is what we want right this is what we want incoming to be but I think incoming technically does the opposite I think it goes from the 
[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4548) surface to the camera which means I can just multiply this by negative 1 and it will give us what we want so I take incoming I Vector Mass you can use multiply or like we talked about scale 
[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4556) by1 now it's going to be you know the opposite I use this over here and now is this the same thing it might still be a bit different let's see our reflection coordinates versus or theirs versus ours 
[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4566) nope it's the exact same thing so uh We've calculated a reflection coordinate system and it makes sense how we did that at least it makes sense to me hopefully it makes sense to you once we 
[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4573) have this coordinate system we can say that the world our environment had any kind of texture that it's now sampling so kind of an obvious example that we get for free like we talked about is 
[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4581) this noise texture so unlike before and let's make this kind of higher contrast over here so we can see what we're doing okay yeah that looks pretty good uh unlike before where it sticks onto the 
[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4590) surface because this is view dependent with the incoming you can see that this gives you know a reflection definitely for this ground plane it looks like a mirror uh you could swap this with 
[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4597) anything so let's do a wave texture so now we have waves reflecting it turns out that we can actually just like we put in our world a custom environment texture so this is called a environment 
[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4608) texture it's not a normal texture there is a difference uh we could load one of those in so with our reflection coordinates let's load in not an image texture but in an environment texture 
[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4616) you're going to notice the differences other than the name of course uh the most important thing is this thing that says equ rectangular uh this is important let me show you because if you 
[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4623) look at an hdri it's a 360Â° image but it has to be represented in a rectangle and this weird distorted thing where this section Pac-Man teleports over here uh this is just called equi rectangular cuz 
[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4633) it's a rectangle and it preserves area or something I'm not sure this has equ rectangular whereas this only has other kinds of projections so in the environment texture I'm going to choose 
[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4641) this burnt Warehouse which by default kind of gives this we weird kind of thing either way this is not what we want we want the reflection coordinate system and now you can imagine right 
[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4649) especially with this sphere is like a chrome ball you can see the environment reflected we can actually enable our scene again and this should give us what we need so in the ceiling we have wood 
[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4658) planks plus this uh sideways wood Plank and you can see that reflected there's a reason the word is reflected uh we need it to be in our kind of bsdf here okay so we know our bsdf has color that we 
[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4668) then like shade with our DOT product I want to also include a hit of color from our reflection so first of all we have have our color that I want to contribute so we have our mixing and everything so 
[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4678) our mixing just darkens it uh before or multiplication before I do that I want to mix it with a another color I want to tint it by a custom color so I'm going to put a input over here instead of 
[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4687) color I'm going to call this or maybe like World color or something like that and I can move that above so that the color and the world color are together I want to mix this with our uh thing over 
[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4696) here so not just the color or not just the world but the world using a reflection coordinates so I'm going to put this right here let's view it it's going to give us what we had before but 
[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4704) now with some refle it and still with our Darkness so it kind of just works right like now we have something much more Dynamic let me get rid of this but this isn't technically probably the best 
[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4713) way to do this the reason for it is it's mixing the uh color and the reflection equally everywhere it's the same on the edge it's the same here uh and in reality that's not how it works if you 
[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4722) think about it imagine you have here's another analogy imagine you have a puddle of water okay or maybe a lake if I'm the viewer and I view the lake from over here so I'm kind of standing on the 
[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4730) beach uh I'm looking at the lake and that is going to reflect this way or like upward and it's going to show maybe the sky or maybe some trees in the distance however uh when I look at it 
[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4739) from the top you might notice that when you're on a boat and you look directly down at the water you don't really see much of a reflection if anything you kind of see into the water you see the 
[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4746) depth as it goes down down down getting darker into the surface whereas if you look from a different angle you see the reflectivity so it turns out that the surface normal versus our incoming 
[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4755) Vector take a DOT product gives us in some sense maybe an inverse of how reflective it should be right so dot products are used everywhere wherever we have a surface normal remember did we we 
[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4764) end up using a Fel uh we have a Fel that basically gives us exactly that right so in reality if we look directly into the surface like this part of the sphere it's going to be black is which means 
[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4773) that it's not going to have much reflectivity but on the edges We Get Much More reflection and we can control that beautiful and by the way I should mention now that we have our custom 
[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4781) normal coordinates you're going to notice that for now just like anything else with a normal socket by default uses these coordinates you can add our fake coordinate system and in the Fel 
[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4789) you're going to see it adds that fake detail as if it was contributing to the view angle so that's just a thing uh but because we our Fel we can mix in our reflectivity that we can kind of say how 
[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4798) intense is it also by this Fel so I'm going to do that here it's going to be quite subtle but there is some reflection going on here there is some reflection and you want to make sure 
[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4806) that the world color is in the bottom socket so let's see this is without it's just color and then this is with and let's see if this does what we want so if we look at this kind of like a 
[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4814) hardwood floor from this angle quite reflective but as I look up no longer reflective and we can see that in the cube we can have this I which remember is affecting the uh reflectivity it's 
[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4823) also affecting this kind of like addition we did over here or was it a multiplication I don't know we just added like a bit of something uh we can make that a parameter so now I is here 
[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4832) uh I is different for different surfaces it turns out water has 1.33 whereas glass has 1.5 whereas other things much higher you can think of these as Metals I'm going to keep it at 1.5 we have our 
[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4841) nice reflections with our nice lighting kind of the last thing kind of the last piece of the recipe I think we're missing is if you look at the Reflections in a diffuse bsdf or I guess 
[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4850) actually let's do a reflective one what what's it called like glossy so glossy bsdf gives us the reflections you're going to see that it kind of scatters or diffuses the reflection unless I set the 
[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4859) roughness to zero where we have what we had before right nearly identical except for the uh reflections of the objects themselves but the main thing we are missing is kind of this uh roughness how 
[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4868) much does the thing scatter well here I'm going to show you a trick so you can think of scattering of light of a texture of whatever as basically blurring it approximately I don't know 
[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4876) if that's true but you can think of it as blurring um so if we can make a blurring node we can kind of fake roughness here so I want you to imagine not an image texture I want you to 
[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4883) imagine we have very kind of like very visual texture like a vorono texture which has all these cells if I want to blur this it should kind of look like fuzzy uh on the edges and in fact fuzzy 
[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4893) everywhere now the question is what is blurring well if I take this point on the edge ultimately should be kind of the average of everything around it the way that works is for this point it 
[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4901) samples a bit over here and then it samples a bit over here and actually it samples in every direction and for each one it says oh this is orange this is orange this is cream and for every 
[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4908) sample it adds and averages them out together but our blurring is more effective the more kind of directions that we sample so somehow I want to sample this in every direction and blur 
[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4917) it and all this there is a node that we actually already talked about that does this what is it well remember that our you know whatever texture usually by default uses generated coordinates what 
[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4927) I want to do is we already know how to sample right we just shift it a bit to the side like we did with our normals I want to shift it but kind of like everywhere of course that's not possible 
[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4934) because we can only pick a single Direction at a time but if you look at this like cluster of points that kind of represents this one if every single point inside of here kind of picks a 
[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4942) different one and they're so close together it will look about right well how do we like pick random directions how do we know how to do that well remember remember when we were 
[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4948) randomizing we used this thing called The White Noise texture which if we use generated coordinates gives us a number between 0 and one on every single point no matter how close together but so too 
[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4956) can we pick a random color a three-dimensional X Y and Z Vector which we can think of as a direction this is a way to sample random directions right it gives us random things so if I sample 
[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4965) this way like I do a bit of an offset you're going to see that it looks kind of ridiculous right because we have our generated coordinates and then I'm adding this massive blur well I can take 
[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4973) this contribu and basically make it less intense the same way that we made our normal custom normal contribution less intense so as I scale this down let me set it to zero we have this and then as 
[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4983) I shift it you're going to see it blurs but you are going to see a bit of an issue you're going to see yes it blurs but it also kind of goes off to the side as if it's kind of being uh pushed 
[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4989) diagonally so it's being pushed downwards and diagonally why is that it should be picking random directions on average it should not really move if you think about it if we're picking a random 
[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=4997) direction right that's not actually that it's really just a number between zero and one but on the X Y and Z like we have three random number generators that go between 0 and 1 that means that on 
[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5007) average if you average them all out it's going to pick a number basically that's 0.5 on average this means that on average we are shifting our coordinates by 0.5 on X Y and Z uh multiplied by our 
[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5017) scale of course we don't want this sampling from 0 to 1 but instead we want it centered so you can think of it as instead of 0 to 1 we can map range to - 1 to1 did you know you can take a map 
[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5026) range and instead of a float you can use a vector which is basically the same thing as a color you take a input interval and you send it to an output interval so it's going from 0 to 1 one 
[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5034) on X Y and Z and we want to map it to negative 1 to1 just so it's centered and what you're going to see now is it's or it's not blurred and as we increase it it blurs quite intensely actually but uh 
[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5043) it does it in a way that's uniform and stays uh centered now the reason this blurs so incredibly fast is the directions these are sampling uh isn't just like this way but it's this way 
[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5051) with a giant magnitude right trying to kind of solve that by bringing down the scale but some of these can be pretty big if you just care about the direction we know we can normalize so this is 
[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5059) without this is with going to be kind of subtle but it will kind of work here what was the point of this we wanted it for for blurring our reflection texture uh so for now I'm just going to add a 
[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5067) empty thing the reason I'm doing that is I want to highlight contrl G you need to have an output for this to actually you know come out with this Vector what I mean by this is if I didn't have this 
[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5075) here and I control G uh there would be no output so contrl G I'm going to call this like blurring in some sense and we don't just want to blur necessarily the generated coordinates although often we 
[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5084) do uh I want to blur a custom coordinate system okay so this is going to be blurred coordinates and this is going to be our coordinates so we input coordinates we output uh blurred 
[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5094) coordinates so ultimately we have our reflection image I'm going to pass this reflected coordinate system through our blurring and is it perfect uh but we've uh essentially blurred and you can see 
[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5104) these boka balls uh let's add a parameter of course for how strong this is and instead of doing this directly where the numbers have to be very small uh let's divide it by let's see if we 
[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5112) have 03 let's divide it by 10 for example which means 03 effectively becomes 3 as we increase it it gets very diffuse and as we decrease it it becomes quite sharp and you can use this 
[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5123) blurring for all kinds of things that we did before but either way I view this now we indeed have our Reflections which I might want to see more of or less of but I can also control effectively the 
[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5134) roughness of those Reflections so zero one it ain't perfect but it's an honest living um I guess kind of like a final thing uh to note is we have control over where the reflection appears how rough 
[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5142) it is uh but we don't have like a general strength slider I guess so we are like using the Fel here but what if I want to take this for now and kind of modify it well we can either kind of 
[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5152) modify it with a multiplication so as I increase this it kind of gets more metallic and as I decrease this it kind of gets more diffuse or you can think of it as a addition where it's uniform I 
[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5160) think obviously multiplication makes more sense so I'm going to call this reflectivity right so now our reflectivity is at zero we can increase it and now it's more reflective if I 
[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5169) wanted it to be a nice metal I'd pick kind of like a darkish color with um high reflectivity and maybe a low uh blurring and yeah let us do just a bit of experimenting we don't need to have 
[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5180) this hdri we could have picked this outdoor Forest one that I actually want to see and let's also bring down our reflectivity so we can see all of this maybe .5 maybe let's bring down the I 
[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5190) and bring up the strength of our normal coordinates I mean you know you can't get better than that so what have we done in this tutorial series just to recap we can go further maybe I don't 
[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5199) think I want to at the moment we went from basically going uh with a single value node we just talked about what is a number what does it do how does it represent a kind of surface output we 
[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5207) done talked about vectors colors how to like multiply how to use dot product and use all these methodologies uh to basically recreate the diffuse bsdf um but fully custom with the drivers that 
[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5217) let us kind of pick our lighting uh nicely so we created essentially what we call a bsdf really this is just a Shader that responds to lighting and Reflections and all this kind of stuff 
[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5226) so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial Series where do you want to take this from here you might be wondering probably the next step is going over other bsdfs and talking about 
[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5235) transparency and all this but what we were building to is kind of recreating the granddaddy of bsdfs which is the principled right it has this metallic which you can think of as our 
[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5244) reflectivity kind of makes it more metallic it has roughness which you can think of as our blurring um it has I color we're kind of building towards that it has normals but what it's 
[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5253) missing is it doesn't have a mission we don't have transmission so hopefully you learned something that is what I know for kind of like a level one if you want to level two maybe beg and maybe I will 
[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDBZ7CwlfIs&t=5262) do it the man puts on his hood in mystery as he creates the best tutorial of all time

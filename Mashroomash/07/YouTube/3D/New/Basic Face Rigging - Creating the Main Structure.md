[00:04](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=4) okay so we're gonna get going with the with the rig so like i said we're gonna be using uh this one and i'm just i just loaded 
[00:13](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=13) the the model that we're gonna be providing and we're going to start with the basic structure which is basically neck head joint and the jaw joints 
[00:23](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=23) nothing else really for the time being so yeah before we get started with uh with any joint placement so we have to we have to think about the anatomy a little bit so i'm just 
[00:36](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=36) gonna go to the side view it's always useful especially on on a more realistic character to think about the anatomy and the underneath 
[00:45](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=45) so you know where to place the joint so in this case we're just gonna be uh we're just gonna do like a quick kind of drawing of how the how the skeleton 
[00:58](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=58) will be under this motor roughly kind of like this we have something like this it has to be it doesn't have to have to be like super accurate but it's more 
[01:10](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=70) like a rough representation and then if we think about like jaw roughly where it's gonna be sitting 
[01:19](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=79) so we have something like this and then thinking about the vertebrae so it's gonna be something like this so this is what we have the two most important points that we care here is uh 
[01:39](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=99) about the head joint and the jaw joint so as a rule of thumb for the head joint um this has to be where the vertebrae meets the base of the skull so it's roughly gonna be somewhere 
[01:53](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=113) around here so normally that pivot point could be like behind the ears this is almost as if you draw like a line from one side of the neck to 
[02:02](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=122) the other and then we can have like uh we don't need too many joints but we can have something like something there and something there 
[02:13](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=133) something like this and for the jaw pivot um especially like i said on unrealistic models is gonna have it's gonna be around this again like a point of reference if you touch your own 
[02:31](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=151) face just like uh in front of like this point on your ear and then if you open the jaw you will feel the skeleton underneath 
[02:43](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=163) moving as you open the jaw so it's a good um placement to have it like roughly there and that's that's where we can put the joints so and with 
[02:56](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=176) with that already there what we can do is go to rigging skeleton create joints and we're literally gonna be like clicking there and then we click there and then 
[03:12](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=192) there let's just show them so that's where we have them and then roughly there and then we're always going to put like a final joint in there 
[03:25](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=205) this is mainly so we kind of have like a representation of it some people prefer to not have any kind of final joint because those are never 
[03:36](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=216) going to be used but it's mainly so maya draws this this line now we press the down key to go back to this joint actually the up key sorry to go up the 
[03:49](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=229) hierarchy so if you go up and you go down so we go up to go back to that one because here we want to place the jaw so we're gonna place it roughly 
[04:01](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=241) there and then again we just put like a tip joint in there and that's that's where our skeleton 
[04:09](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=249) is gonna be so let me just select all these and put like um even two something like this and obviously i think i 
[04:22](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=262) moved somehow so i'm just gonna delete this because now it doesn't really matter anyway and okay so that's that's how we have it so now we're gonna be just renaming 
[04:39](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=279) so and just call it neck zero joint make one make two 
[04:57](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=297) and then this is c head joint and then let's just call all the tip joints tip so for example here is joe and then this one 
[05:16](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=316) is job tip oops okay so that's that's it so and we save just be careful and always kind of save as soon as you have something just in 
[05:28](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=328) case um so yeah that's that's it so now we're gonna be quickly always check obviously if if you know that the joints are going to be in the middle 
[05:40](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=340) you can draw them on the side view and you can always draw them on the side view and then if anything you can always move them a little bit but obviously we 
[05:50](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=350) want them in the middle so that's it so that's fine also like check that the orientations are going to be correct so we always want in in this case we're going to use x 
[06:02](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=362) pointing down and then just make sure that y up is consistent and it didn't kind of move the other way so basically when we select all these joints we have them 
[06:15](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=375) rotating in the same direction and then again here we have x pointing so that's that's all good so for the now before skinning we're going to create the controls 
[06:29](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=389) so for that um we're just going to be using simple shapes so we're gonna go to nerfs primitives and create a circle or we can create 
[06:39](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=399) squares that's fine but let's just create um actually let's do one thing let's create a circle and a square oh actually square may not be great 
[06:55](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=415) because it has like all these four so let's let's just stick to circles and we just group it so literally it's gonna be at the origin and with another group so unless for now 
[07:09](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=429) just give it like a generic name control group and then control cgl and you always want when having controls you will you always want like 
[07:22](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=442) at least one group on top because whenever you move it and you place it you want all the information of where it is to be stored in that group and 
[07:32](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=452) have this control zero out so when you use it and then if you move the control and move the rig you always want to like when you set zero it goes back to where 
[07:42](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=462) it should be so that's why we create this group on top and so yeah we're going to be using these 
[07:50](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=470) just simple sphere um circles you could always if you install comet you could always you use in the shapes you have diff more variety of shapes or maybe you 
[08:05](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=485) have your own tool set that you downloaded where you can create like a bigger variety of controls i just want to stick to what maya gives and we're just gonna be we can still 
[08:16](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=496) reshape it and make nice shapes of it so if you select the control and right click ctrl vertex we can still move these 
[08:26](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=506) control points and shape it into something else so we're going to be using eventually but for now let's just let's just keep that and we're going to always keep this 
[08:36](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=516) control because it's going to be useful to just duplicate it to create the controls so we're going to create one control per neck joint and the head and the jaw so we're 
[08:46](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=526) going to duplicate it five times so one actually let's just duplicate it this first time and we'll call it 
[08:59](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=539) next zero group and next zero control and then duplicate it a couple of times because that's gonna be one 
[09:17](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=557) one and then this is gonna be neck two okay and then we duplicate it once again and that's gonna be the head group and the head ctl 
[09:42](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=582) and now we have the job and so control okay so now we have obviously that all of them at the origin uh let's call this layer 
[10:02](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=602) model layer so we can hide the model for the time being so now what we want to do is place all these controls where they should be 
[10:19](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=619) and so for that let's just select one joint and then the group remember we want to do it on the group and then let's do a constraint parent 
[10:28](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=628) maintain offset uh it's just gonna be like a temporary uh placement so we just want it to be snapped in there and making sure that we have the 
[10:40](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=640) uh orientation and the position correct so we do we do the same for all of them so we do this one now we can just press g and it will redo the same type of constraint 
[10:50](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=650) and then we select the neck and we delete it again we just want to snap it so that's that's all we want to do and head same and we delete it and now 
[11:06](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=666) and that's done cool obviously let's hide this one because it may get distracting so now we want to shape them a bit so let's just 
[11:17](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=677) disable the possibility of selecting joints and geometry because we want to select all these and go to component mode select all these and 
[11:33](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=693) obviously you see if we have that it's gonna rotate the shapes in the bad way so we go to the tool settings and we set it to object 
[11:42](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=702) so now it's just doing this because that's all we want to do is to have this control uh perpendicular to the join so and now what we do is press j 
[11:55](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=715) and that will that see if that enables uh the step and now we can just rotate in 15 degrees increment and now like we basically rotate it like 90 degrees and now the other thing we want to do is 
[12:12](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=732) we want to scale it so it's actually visible and again the scale you want to have it on the object because what happens if you don't have it on the object 
[12:22](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=742) is that if you have the scale on default it's just gonna scale in this bad way so we want it in object because all we want to do is like literally 
[12:32](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=752) make each one of them individually a bit bigger so we have that so now what we can do is just go in like tweak them so this one is a bit 
[12:45](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=765) bigger this one if anything this one could be left as it is this one maybe this one should be fine and then this 
[12:58](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=778) one let's make it bigger and we can move it slightly because remember we're just tweaking the shape and so it is a bit more prominent 
[13:11](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=791) we're just gonna shape it slightly different so we're just gonna move it like this and now it's a bit more clear that this one is going to be 
[13:24](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=804) a different type of control and now we're going to do the same for the jump we're just gonna shape it so for the job maybe it's gonna be more than enough 
[13:39](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=819) to just scale it in a way that we show this so i think that should be enough so we go back to the object mode 
[13:55](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=835) so now we have these controls and now what we're going to be doing is um tweaking the colors so again save and we select the control 
[14:11](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=851) we go to the attribute editor and on the shape we go to object display drawing overrides enable override and then we go let's go 
[14:20](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=860) to like a green color so you have to just move around until you get so actually maybe this one is better 
[14:28](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=868) so it's not like too harsh and this one we're gonna go for like a yellow this one yellow and this one again and yellow this one again we'll go for 
[14:46](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=886) the green actually we passed it this one and then this one again we can go for the yellow cool so that's um the controls created 
[15:05](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=905) now we're just gonna be parenting so what we want to do is have the same kind of hierarchy as we have on the joints so what we do is we select the job 
[15:16](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=916) group and we want it under the head control and we press p and then the head group under the neck to join we press p the next group in the 
[15:26](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=926) next two group and under neck one and we press p which means parenting and then the neck one group under zero control and we press p 
[15:38](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=938) so now as you can see we can just move around and now what we have to do is um select the control this time the control so i'm gonna show all these 
[15:54](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=954) so it's clear control and then shift select the join actually i just need to enable again to be able to select the join so select 
[16:05](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=965) the control and the join you can do it on the outliner i'm just doing on the viewport because it's a bit more in front of me and constrain parent 
[16:15](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=975) so in this case it shouldn't matter if we do it maintain an offset or not because we actually snap the control to the joint so there 
[16:25](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=985) shouldn't be any difference so it's a good exercise but just take into account if you're snapping the control to the joint and all of a sudden the 
[16:33](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=993) joint kind of moves or rotates or goes somewhere else is because you did it without maintaining offset but also because there's something wrong because they shouldn't be any 
[16:44](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1004) difference because you literally we literally snap the the group on top to the joint so the control is actually where the joint is so when doing this constraint there 
[16:55](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1015) shouldn't be any shifting or movement so we go one by one apply apply and then apply cool so that's it we save again and now 
[17:12](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1032) as you can see the control move the joints so what what i'm going to be doing now is just before finishing with this video because on the next video we're going to 
[17:25](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1045) be moving to the skinning so it's a good practice so first of all let's just for now hide everything except the head that's what we want to skin for the time being 
[17:37](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1057) so so it helps you while skinning what we're going to be doing is a simple animation with different poses so what we're gonna be doing is going zero here 
[17:48](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1068) and then two like um something like this and we select all these joints and we do like a key pressing s we have a key every like 10 frames something like this 
[18:07](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1087) 70 80 90 100 10 20. um so now obviously i have the auto key on so as soon as i move anything it's gonna 
[18:23](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1103) create another key so let's just kind of go and rotate like 12 degrees and then minus 12 and then we back to neutral and then on this one we just go back 
[18:46](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1126) like another 12 something minus 12 5 and then we're just gonna twist eight eight and then back to neutral and now we're 
[19:08](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1148) just gonna be that's back to neutral so here on 100 actually let's just put some keys and then here and we're going to be cleaning up and 
[19:23](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1163) just getting rid of some channels that we're not going to be using normally on the job apart from rotating from a certain point it's going to move a little bit but we're not going to go 
[19:34](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1174) into that what we're going to be doing is we're gonna be leaving translational rotation free so it can be tweaked a bit more the 
[19:43](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1183) scale is gonna be locked eventually so we'll just do that uh later on but we're just gonna leave it like that so what we're going to be doing is for the jo open 
[19:53](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1193) pose we're just going to be rotating a little bit so we're going to rotate like 17 or something like this and then like from this point on 
[20:12](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1212) uh just gonna move it slightly and that's kind of what will happen so it will rotate a little bit and then from a certain point it's gonna move 
[20:23](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1223) a tiny bit it's just an approximation but just so you know it happens and and is to to check our skin actually okay so now that we 
[20:33](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1233) have the skeleton and the controls everything connected we're gonna go into creating the skin cluster 
[20:40](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1240) and um skinning these main joints for the time being so we're gonna be selecting from all the joints obviously just the main ones we don't care about the the 
[20:52](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1252) tip joints and we're gonna select the geometry for now like i said we're just gonna be focusing on on the on the head geometry and we go to skin bind skin but let's go 
[21:05](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1265) to the options and let's go reset because obviously i may have something different and the first thing we want to change is instead of hierarchy to select the 
[21:15](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1275) joints otherwise it's going to ignore basically what we selected and just add everything on the hierarchy so basically that way you will only need to select the neck 
[21:24](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1284) and then it will select everything everything else we're going to leave as it is because we also want this rig to be able to run into a game engine 
[21:37](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1297) um we should be fine as it is but we have to be mindful of the max influence but obviously we're not we're not going to be [Music] 
[21:47](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1307) allowing us for that to be an issue but just so you know five should be enough for a game engine but obviously oh and if you are not rigging for for a game engine you don't care about that so 
[22:01](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1321) you cannot check that but we're just gonna keep it uh for the time being even though is it it should be fine but we'll just keep it at five 
[22:09](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1329) that's fine that's more than enough and it doesn't quite matter so closest distance all of that is going to be fine because uh to be honest we just want to 
[22:20](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1340) create the skin cluster the default skin in maya does even if you select heat map or geodesic voxel is not going to be great anyway so we might as well just 
[22:33](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1353) bind skin and that's it and now obviously we're going to have something so it moves but and it may look fine but the thing is if 
[22:43](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1363) anything is too soft and as you can see so we move the jaw and it's literally deforming everything so what we're gonna do is 
[22:56](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1376) so we go here and we're just gonna float everything to the first joint and again you you may have your own tools like you can see i have ng skin 
[23:08](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1388) tools here you may have your own skinning tools if you have them by all means use them and especially if you've used them before but we're not 
[23:20](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1400) going to be using any of that i just want to show the what maya provides without expecting you to have this plug-in or that plug-in or that tool 
[23:28](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1408) so we're just going to use what maya does even though for skinning it's not it's not great so we'll go to the um right view and then with the next one 
[23:40](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1420) so we're gonna float to like one everything so oops sorry and we just press b to make this bigger so with b pressed and the left mouse we can make 
[23:52](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1432) this brush bigger and we're just gonna paint actually just like this and that's just mainly as a guidance if anything so let's just 
[24:04](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1444) actually let's we can paint one side and then we can just mirror so for now let's just stick with that and then make two 
[24:17](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1457) obviously this eventually will have to be the jaw but don't worry about that let's just do it like this for the time being and then we'll just put the head 
[24:30](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1470) with all these so we're just doing like a essentially big strokes and then just like painting roughly everything so now we can go a bit more in detail 
[24:50](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1490) obviously we want the whole ear to be with the hand and then something like this and then for the jaw so let's just 
[25:09](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1509) do skin mirror let's check the options and plane z and y close the component one to one closest join so just make sure that you do it like this 
[25:21](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1521) so you can check the options i have in the mirror and that should be fine so now we have both sides obviously we want to paint all these inside so let's just paint it 
[25:35](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1535) we don't need to mirror again we'll just paint all these so we have that oops so we have this so i don't see any okay so it should be all fine 
[25:59](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1559) okay the nose and obviously we have to paint most of the if not all the gums less for now go inside the gums and just 
[26:14](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1574) paint everything to the head including bits of the jaw we'll just paint them to the jaw later on okay so that's all we've done we just painted the head a bit more 
[26:36](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1596) so let's just check obviously there is still some stuff on the neck zero so what we do is we just paint it a bit more in there all these 
[26:50](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1610) and then this area for the neck too okay so we do a mirror again skin mirror and then 
[27:13](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1633) we save again just in case and now what we're going to be doing for the jaw is just you can just select like one middle edge and ctrl right click to vertices to 
[27:26](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1646) vertices and then shift and like the bigger then is is roughly next to the shift is the bigger than 
[27:40](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1660) key and then we kind of get all these and then we go to paint and then we put it to the jaw and then we paint it into the jaw and obviously we want a bit 
[27:54](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1674) more so we just want at least all that to be under the jaw influence so we just paint this half and then we go again to the 
[28:13](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1693) skin mirror and now if we check so we save again and now if we move the animation obviously there's still some bits and pieces so we paint this to the head 
[28:30](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1710) and to the head so now we don't have anything weird still influenced by the neck so we have everything kind of what it should be okay cool so we have that and now as i was saying 
[28:46](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1726) let's just hide these so we only see that the joints and the mesh obviously you can see it's not great but at least it's moving so what we want to do 
[28:59](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1739) is like go to different poses and start smoothing so what we have to do and like i said if you're using some of the tools 
[29:09](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1749) it's less of a problem but obviously using much skinning you have to be careful and when when you're smoothing try to just keep the two that you want 
[29:18](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1758) to smooth so it kind of smooths between the two and then you can just go here and start smoothing a little bit and again we can do 
[29:30](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1770) just one side so you start smoothing them and we can use these colors to see a bit more and then we can just check um lock neck one 
[29:46](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1786) and then unlock neck two so we can smooth between these two and now what we can do is start smoothing there and we'll worry about the the jaw 
[30:06](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1806) later on so for now let's just keep going in here and then here we can just go to actually let's go to the head and then we can 
[30:20](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1820) smooth in there so we have it there so now we have something a bit smoother and then you always go back to the initial 
[30:35](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1835) one and then go skin mirror and now should look much nicer obviously we still have the the jaw area but you can see here already 
[30:46](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1846) it's looking nicer and then one thing we can do we can just still go further in there and maybe just check in here and keep smoothing a little bit 
[30:58](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1858) just be careful but and in this case you can see um i have all of them kind of unchecked because at this point maya should do a bit of a better job anyway 
[31:19](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1879) something like this should be enough and we have this so that should be cool but in general be careful not to smooth 
[31:28](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1888) um with too many influences unselected because it can get it can get messy so with that let's just go to the job so a few things that we want 
[31:42](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1902) to do in there so while it's slightly open so let's just go here and for the time being let's just go between the jaw and the head that's all we want 
[31:54](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1914) and let's just we're going to be switching between the add and the smooth so let's just have like something like point zero 
[32:05](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1925) 25 something like that and then this brush that has a bit of a fade off and then we can start first of all we're gonna be adding so if you press 
[32:18](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1938) ctrl before you click it's gonna add the opposite of that so if you have a small value but you press ctrl it's gonna you can 
[32:26](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1946) see it says so this is at and this is a inverse and so we can add all these we're going to be adding um joints in here for the mouth so 
[32:40](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1960) we don't i mean we still care but just so you know we just want like a rough jaw movement anyway because eventually we're gonna be replacing some of these influence 
[32:56](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1976) by some of the mouth controls so we now add a bit and we can start smoothing and we want something organic so let's just um kind of do 
[33:12](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=1992) a little bit of smoothing in there so we want a bit of the influence from the jaw here so we're gonna be smoothing there and then we also want a bit 
[33:26](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2006) of the influence in there so we keep smoothing a little bit in there we have to be careful there because that's gonna be on the neck so we may have to 
[33:37](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2017) un unlock the neck so we can keep carry on so we go there and we keep smoothing let's move a bit more so let's move this a lot 
[33:53](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2033) it's going to be a lot of that and here we do it as well but like i said we're going to be replacing this with um some mouth controls 
[34:08](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2048) so we just want mainly what we want is like the beyond the jaw so we're gonna be we're gonna be focusing on that a bit more so we do this and one thing that we can 
[34:20](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2060) see here is that we want to add a little bit maybe we want to do something a bit bigger so that's a bit more so 
[34:43](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2083) we keep going assuming that's because it's on the next so let's just keep going so we're gonna have to unlock a few 
[34:58](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2098) of the of the joints on the nail because obviously that kind of merges with the with the neck joints so unfortunately we're gonna have to 
[35:12](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2112) deal with a few influences at the time so let's just check let's do a mirror so we actually get and always remember to go back to the zero position 
[35:22](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2122) skin mirror and we can go back to like this movement and actually one thing that we actually want to do is kind of reduce a little bit so maybe 
[35:37](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2137) let's just add a bit of the neck influence to kind of remove some of that movement actually and even possibly some of the neck one that's that's what i don't like about 
[36:06](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2166) what maya does with the skin because it keeps like going into like different random joints that i don't like at all so 
[36:21](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2181) just keep going and check what's happening so let's just add a little bit more there and smooth it 
[36:43](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2203) so what's happening there and then add a bit more there we don't want to add a whole lot but we we want to add a little bit and then 
[36:55](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2215) let's just keep smoothing a little bit there so it has a nice transition obviously and again let's go to zero and skin mirror 
[37:15](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2235) and we go back to that and obviously we just need to kind of smooth and fix the middle bit okay so that's that we keep smoothing we want to like see 
[37:31](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2251) some movement around here as well because we wanted to like feel organic so as you can see like when you open the mouth there is some movement as well 
[37:42](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2262) roughly there so we want to get some of that so let's just continue with these just trying to get something a bit nicer something like this 
[38:01](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2281) oh where am i okay so now we smooth there and we keep smoothing in there cool so we have these so let's just see how it does 
[38:28](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2308) so yeah i think this should be roughly okay um obviously we don't want to have the the jaw influence too much on the neck 
[38:41](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2321) because we don't want it to lose volume and so one thing that we have to do is check now that we have these skins so we want to possibly smooth a little bit some of 
[38:57](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2337) these areas so let's see if he wants to do so let's unlock all that so let's just go here and when you see 
[39:10](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2350) like some vertices doing a little bit of a nasty movement with just all of that we're just gonna smooth it a little bit so we have that 
[39:26](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2366) and also like going generally in here just smooth a tiny bit so that's that's why the colors are a bit more useful than just this because you can see 
[39:36](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2376) actually let's just be careful with all these we want to kind of smooth all that and we don't want any of that so let's just reduce all that 
[39:56](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2396) so let's move all these so we get something nicer so let's just check that you don't have like random influence where it shouldn't be all 
[40:13](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2413) these we can remove just be careful okay so let's go back to zero and skin mirror let's just save and now we can check 
[40:30](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2430) again so it looks okay and then yeah that should be fine so let's do one thing um further for the jaw so i think we can 
[40:49](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2449) still let's just hide the actual joints and let's just try to add a little bit more there just tiny bit so just be careful 
[41:00](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2460) not to go too crazy but just tiny bit in there so we get a bit more of a movement see something like this should be fine so we have that 
[41:24](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2484) and then again skin mirror skin weights and so yeah that's it for the for the skinning of the main bits so once you have that obviously you go to edit keys 
[41:44](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2504) delete keys and let's go to the options and instead of selected you go to all and then delete keys and you will get rid of everything but you can still like use it 
[41:54](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2514) and you can check it and just make sure that everything is working fine we can still like go later on and and and clean up a little bit because we're 
[42:04](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2524) going to be adding other pieces so for now we just kind of want a blocking of the skinning but because we're going to be adding controls for the ears we're going to be adding 
[42:14](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2534) controls for the for the mouth different bits of the lips and and other bits and pieces so we just want like a rough already working block 
[42:25](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2545) skinning and then we can always refine as we move along and we see issues we can always refine so that's more than done good enough for now and so yeah we're gonna stop here so you 
[42:39](https://youtu.be/pLRxzsPAqrE?si=Hssi09b5Tnzll4dd&t=2559) can save once you delete the skinning and then i have seen for now we're just done with the with the main structure and we'll just move move on to the next bit

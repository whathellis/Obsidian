[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=3) hi everyone and welcome to chapter six in this chapter it is all about texturing my favorite part um and i want to talk about a few key elements actually 
[00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=13) um you know things that i think about as i'm working um things that i've learned through the process and you know that's the really fun thing about substance painter is 
[00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=22) that every time i'm in here i'm learning new things and when i'm not inside a substance painter i'm watching tutorials from other artists 
[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=29) and learning new things so that i can bring those into my own personal workflows and pipelines so let's go ahead and dive right in and start talking about our 
[00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=38) metals and what i was thinking about for those i did lean towards the cooler side of the color palette or i should say the cooler side of these 
[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=48) neutral colors and i wanted to have an accent color i knew that from the get-go and based on some of the pieces that i had for reference i 
[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=57) decided that i wanted to go with an orange accent and just have this really really nice pop of color from these neutral neutral colors right 
[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=67) and i think that was really really an awesome touch to have in here because if i didn't then it would be just kind of boring 
[01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=75) a little bit more along the lines of a storm trooper as far as it just being a black and white metal and i i really wanted to try to have something 
[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=83) that would would punch and then ultimately tie that into my final renders later on and i think the orange works really really well 
[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=92) um and actually i'm going to talk a bit about these decals in a few minutes because i learned some new things and i'm really really happy with the technique of using projections 
[01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=102) but before i get into that let's talk a little bit more about these base materials now i have a bare metal that i've created 
[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=110) and that bare metal is at the very very bottom of my stack here just above just this base layer which is to make sure that i don't end up with any 
[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=120) um pure white or null value really this is just kind of the a clamp here uh in us in a sense it's gonna catch anything that i might have 
[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=130) missed um that was really minor and um that's why i have that here sometimes i'll switch it to red just to see if there is anything 
[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=138) that i missed um but that's why that this is here and uh the bare metal um is great but i didn't want it to be everywhere because that's just not very 
[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=149) realistic i wanted to be on just a few pieces so i have it here and i have it here in this inner piece here and of course if i so chose and i 
[02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=160) scratched away the primer layer then i would have that bare metal show up as well but it also just adds some extra little details to the surface 
[02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=169) that are usually pretty micro in most cases little little irregularities in the surface and i keep those in my bare metal 
[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=179) so the primer layer is pretty straightforward i ultimately wanted to go with a darker value for the primer so that it would pop uh when 
[03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=190) um when exposed uh with the uh the white metal here right so it's just like this nice contrast between the white and now this darker primer and 
[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=200) so that i it will pop it'll be more noticeable and then that way when i have edges like this that i want to you know highlight here in a different 
[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=209) way then it's it's more noticeable than it would be if it was just bare metal right um and because of the value of the primer it's also 
[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=220) in this um color range that it shows up in the black metal too so i have just the same primer throughout all the metal pieces all the painted metal pieces 
[03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=232) so it's really really nice to be able to just paint away black metal or white metal and then see that that primer under there so it's just the same primer applied 
[04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=243) it's really neat and the reason i do that is because well in reality when we're scratching painted surfaces typically we're not going to see just 
[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=251) bare metal underneath there is a primer layer now in previous assets that i've created i will will sometimes you know go that gamey route where we exaggerate 
[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=262) we want to show the bare metal scratch because it's shiny and that's cool um and i'll actually have techniques in which the the primer is is uh hugging 
[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=273) the edge of the exposed paint so you're just seeing little bits of pieces of the primer you're not seeing it more intact like in this version but for for this i wanted to go a little bit more 
[04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=288) towards realism and i was like well realistically again if i wanted to see bare metal on this i'd have to scratch the hell out of it almost intentionally 
[04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=297) right or something would have to have a regular interaction here to show me that bare metal underneath and so i chose to just have that primer but 
[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=306) mostly mostly because i wanted to have the contrast between the white and this dark primer because it's just going to show up better 
[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=316) than bare metal so that was really the intention beyond it so let's move up our layer here and we start talking about the painted metal 
[05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=327) and the white metal now for the white metal right off the bat i knew based on a bunch of the reference i was looking at that 
[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=336) i wanted to go for this sci-fi white metal that's you know really really glossy and shiny and just looks really really nice right and then we get these 
[05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=346) which which you know in turn means that we get these really nice contrast and roughness break up between like dirt and scratches and all these other fun 
[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=355) little bits so that's why i chose this particular white but i knew right away that the black paint i needed to make 
[06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=365) different and i didn't want to go shinier so i went with a um more matte look to the black paint to add this nice material break up so 
[06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=375) yes they're both metal but they're different roughness values and that's important because it just helps add more visual interest to our asset here 
[06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=386) and if i switch to the roughness channel so that we can visualize the reference you can see just how complex these materials are and all the layering that is occurring 
[06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=398) between all the layering of the dirt and the grime and all these little scratches and just everything that's layering layering adding all this visual interest i even 
[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=408) have uh based on some feedback i got from from friends and colleagues to add in uh you know shinier kind of oily stains to the black metal 
[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=418) to help it pop more um just in you know different highlighted areas so that when the light catches one of those sections we can see 
[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=427) it's just like a little smudge of oil or something that's collected on the black metal it just makes it pop in different spots but getting this material breakup is 
[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=437) just really important for making our assets look realistic and believable and more importantly just visually complex and fun to look at 
[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=449) so moving right along i'm going to talk about i'm not really going to talk about the wires or the rubber foot because those are pretty straightforward there's 
[07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=460) nothing particularly fancy about them um you know we can see here that yes there is a roughness breakup in in those materials 
[07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=469) between that and the rest of our services and they they suffice in the job from a circle to the decals because i thought 
[07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=479) that that was something that was particularly interesting that i learned from this process and that i hadn't tried before but right from the beginning 
[08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=488) i knew that i was going to add these stripes and i didn't know where they were going to be necessarily or how i was going to go about it 
[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=498) entirely but i knew that i wanted to try to leverage projections and so if we come here and we look at our decals let's see am i in the right one no let's 
[08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=512) go to the the head because i want to talk about this particular stripe set here so we've got switch to painted metal 
[08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=523) we're going to come down here to paint layer and decals so if i zoom out you can see that there is 
[08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=538) this volume here right and that is the projection and i have the shape crop set to cropped to the shape and so what that means is it's not going to extend 
[09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=551) beyond this volume this volume is controlling where the stripe is occurring right and it's really really cool because if i want to iterate which is a 
[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=562) huge part of game development i can easily nudge this around and start getting different results now of course it's kind of load because recording is sluggish 
[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=572) it's slowing this all down but you can see here it's really easy to just nudge us around and start seeing different results for where our strike placements could be 
[09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=583) right and this is really really cool because you know like i was saying iteration is a huge part of game development and nothing is 
[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=591) really ever done until it shipped and then even then it may not be entirely done but at some point you just have to say pencils down right 
[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=600) and this gives us the flexibility though to come back in and make changes so if an art director comes in and says no no no i don't want the stripe 
[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=609) here i want the stripe over here you can do that very easily then go back in and paint your edge damage or you know you could even set it up so that the edge damage is procedural 
[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=620) i went with a hand method for the stripes here in which i use stencils to paint away and scratch up the the decals here but there's ways that you can make it 
[10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=632) more procedural and i just you know it's a fine balance um you know when i'm painting grunge when i'm painting scratches and wear and tear 
[10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=641) it's a balance between procedural and hand painted methods um i prefer hand painted because it's more purposeful and thoughtful behind it 
[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=651) but procedural methods help me get to a point and then i start subtracting away it's a it's a very common practice that i do i just feel like i end up getting a 
[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=659) more organic approach to edge damage and stuff by allowing the procedural things to kind of lay down a foundation and then i can come in and start 
[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=670) painting away just kind of turn my brain off and start pinning away the edge damage and then getting some different interesting results 
[11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=679) from from those uh from that workflow right so back to the stripes one thing that i thought was particularly clever when i was experimenting 
[11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=688) was that i realized i could add a roughness right here i was able to add a channel here that just impacts the roughness 
[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=700) and that was really really cool to experiment with and learn so that i could control the base roughness here for the decal and then control another roughness value 
[11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=713) for the pattern that i have tiling in here and this is really neat because anywhere the decal is used you know including the triangles and the text 
[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=722) and you know the resolution is a little bit low right now so that's why it looks a little fuzzy and that's just to speed up while i'm recording but 
[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=730) be able to get that that pattern tiling and just where the decals show up is really really neat and cool that it just adds this nice extra little bit of visual interest to 
[12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=740) them at certain lighting conditions right and that was a lot of fun and here's one of the main reasons why i wanted to use this method 
[12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=751) look at our uvs here this would be a huge pain to try to get to line up inside of photoshop i mean extremely painful because of the nature of the way that 
[12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=765) the uvs are laid out and the surface not being boxy we couldn't get particularly straight results in our ues we 
[12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=773) we just wouldn't be able to do that effectively and so because of the projection method it's laid down these perfect lines for our uvs i mean this is great 
[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=785) so you know we have the power of iteration we have the power of it being fast because we don't have to now line up things and 
[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=794) so i was able to really just play around with the stripe design you know at one point i had a stripe down here in the middle like no i don't like that so i i shifted 
[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=802) it over here and i like this asymmetry that it adds it kind of complements the rest of the the asymmetry we have going on here with the cameras 
[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=810) it's just really nice and i feel like it ended up doing a good job of kind of balancing the whole feel of the droid and that pop of orange is just really 
[13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=821) really nice against that white metal so yeah decals are fun if i was gonna do this method again i would of course use 
[13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=832) this for applying decals and maybe stickers and things like that uh for these here i um these you know triangles and these stripes and stuff down here i actually just used the 
[14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=844) stencil method with um believe it or not mirroring it was the first time i used mirroring uh for applying the stencils super powerful 
[14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=853) really awesome because i didn't want to have to apply a sticker here and then shift over and apply a sticker here so being able to use that mirror or symmetry method inside of substance 
[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=863) painter was really cool and allowed me to quickly apply the stencils and move on to other fun parts of the droid 
[14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=873) so let's see what else let's move along and talk about grunge and dirt and what i'm what i'm thinking about when i'm applying grunge so 
[14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=888) for grunge one of the things that i actually take into consideration is complementary colors so obviously i knew that my droid was more on the neutral side 
[14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=899) and a little bit on the cooler side of things so i decided to go with a slightly warmer dirt for the droid and it's even really 
[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=910) more apparent i would say on the black metal here so we look at the painted black metal we can see this warmer value or warmer hue that we have for the dirt and i feel 
[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=924) like that is a really nice complement to the whole droid it's a little less apparent on the much cooler white metal in some ways just because i didn't go as 
[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=935) heavy-handed as i did for the legs because i'm also thinking about how the grunge is being applied to the droid like in context 
[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=946) what is this where is this droid you know running around functioning how are things being damaged on it how or how is grunge and dirt collecting on it 
[15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=956) and so i have a little bit of a thicker application of the grunge on the legs because i'm thinking you know it's running around 
[16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=964) dirt and dust are collecting dirt and dust are collecting on the bottom because it's scraping against you know maybe vegetation rocks dirt 
[16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=973) all those things are being kicked up and hit the bottom so we have a lot of scratches on the bottom decal here and less on the the head because 
[16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=984) it's not going to be getting as scratched up as the bottom would and then we have some fun accents where we've deliberately said we want uh i want a 
[16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=997) scratch here because something has hit the face of this this droid or i'm trying to move the eye around because of little 
[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1005) bits of detail so i've created detail here and then your eye can move here you know so i'm i'm constantly having areas of rest in areas of detail 
[16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1015) and i'm applying that because or i'm applying that based on areas where this damage will also occur so it's it's deliberately thought out of of where i want it and then of course 
[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1029) i'm adding damage to the edges because i want to you know just highlight those edges bring more interest there so that it's even 
[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1037) more apparent that there is an edge there's an angle shift you know those sort of things right um now of course where is grime and grunge going to collect the 
[17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1048) most on this droid well i'm thinking it crevices you know panel lines and and that's two-fold because the grunge also helps 
[17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1059) it be it helps make it more apparent that there's panel lines here right uh and the grunges and dust is collecting on the top 
[17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1070) because this is a you know relatively easier surface up here for dust and dirt to collect uh than it is for the side here because of the shape of 
[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1082) our droid it's less likely that dirt would just be splashed and stick on this particular side of the droid it's going to collect in areas that are 
[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1093) more logical right so the top um you know flat surfaces those areas are going to be able to see more grunge collect easier than it would be for this 
[18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1106) the simple side here so let's talk about the grunge a bit and i can actually dive into the body here we're going to talk about specifically 
[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1118) grunge on the legs and kind of a method that i like to use and i should take a moment to say that you know if you're looking to learn more about texturing you should really 
[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1129) check out stuff from hannah watts and jay cummings both are really amazing artists and i personally i love to learn and so learning new 
[18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1139) stuff from them and their texturing thoughts was really really fun and i definitely encourage everyone to continue to learn 
[19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1148) and improve upon their own personal pipelines and workflows so let's go ahead and look at the grunge here for the legs i'm gonna go ahead and pan up 
[19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1159) where's our dirt and grunge yes here's our master during grudge so if we come down here to grunge bottom we should probably name this bottom 
[19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1170) grunge but i'm using a position here right i'm using a position so if i turn on the mask and i drop down some of these settings 
[19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1185) this is really really fun to play with because if you have say like a crate that you know is going to be sitting out in an open environment and it's 
[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1196) collecting lots of mud and and dirt and dust you're collecting in different areas you can use a lot of cool filters and procedural methods and 
[20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1206) generators to get really awesome results quickly now i'm a huge fan of using position especially for dirt that's building up from the ground 
[20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1216) up because it gives me this nice gradient and that's really important it helps ground assets and i mean it just really adds 
[20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1225) um to everything blending together in a scene and so for this particular instance i have the droid here and i know that grunge and dirt are collecting at 
[20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1234) the feet and then they're going to slowly build up and then fade off now if i want to change this mask i can simply play with the global balance here 
[20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1246) right so i can make it stronger or or weaker um and then i can also shift the position on it so i can say i want the position to be higher so you know maybe 
[21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1266) he's running through the this droid runs through much thicker mud and vegetation and so it's kicking up away more dirt and grime and now 
[21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1278) we have this it's probably more apparent actually in the mask but you can see we have this nice gradient that goes further up but if we wanted it to be tighter maybe 
[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1289) you know maybe he's running around an area that's rocky and so there's actually less uh grime build up we can simply come back down here to our 
[21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1298) position and we can change the balance and so we make it tighter so it's like yeah he's getting some dirt and grime build up here but because the surface of this planet 
[21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1306) is so rocky or wherever he is the biome is so rocky he's not getting as much of this loose dirt and mud and stuff like that collecting and so it's tighter 
[21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1316) right and the same thing if maybe he's in inside mostly and so you know we might want to dial it even more or just make the overall opacity less 
[22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1326) it's really really a cool technique and of course in combination with using fills such as you know ao for masking and things like that we can really start to 
[22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1339) quickly add grunge to areas and exclude other areas that we don't want right so if we have for example this kind of dust right here in which 
[22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1351) it's um the dust is meant to collect on the top portion here right it's meant to to be dust that's being uh it's floating around and it's falling and it's 
[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1365) settling on the tops of surfaces now this light method is really cool i actually picked it up from uh watching jay cummings texturing and light is really awesome however the 
[22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1377) problem with this particular filter or uh generator is that it doesn't take into account all the geometry that's overlapping so if i turn off my ao mask 
[23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1392) you can see that the the light which is directly above our asset is cutting through all i mean so any top surface is getting it which isn't exactly what we want you 
[23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1407) know this area here is being somewhat occluded and so what i did was i tossed in a um a fill with our 
[23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1418) ao map or say we my ao map uh and set this to multiply so that i can start to occlude it so i make it less less less apparent right like i want some build up there but not 
[23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1432) a whole lot because it is occluded and and that way the areas that are really um exposed to the elements are getting 
[24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1441) more of this dust settling from above and it's less on the areas that are being occluded and in fact in some cases it's going to because of our ammo map 
[24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1453) it'll fully occlude those areas and so it'll mask out and they won't receive the dust at all which is also what we want you know for areas like this interior here you know i don't 
[24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1464) really want that to get a whole lot of settling dust at all if any because it is just completely encased almost right so it's really really fun 
[24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1475) but you can start to do and exp with just these different maps and generators and you can start to experiment and get these more realistic believable smart 
[24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1484) materials set up so that you can constantly use these in future projects so that you can just quickly get to texturing the asset get it in-game and 
[24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1494) then fine-tuning that final result as quickly as possible without having to constantly recreate everything from scratch i mean and when i create smart materials 
[25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1504) i'll continue to build upon them if you watch video two of this chapter the time lapse version i actually start with a smart material i 
[25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1513) created a while back for a glass bottle and i took that as a base to start with and then i started tweaking it so now i have a new smart material that i can 
[25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1523) leverage and the same thing with my my grunge and stuff that i've created here um i'm just going to continue to iterate and rebuild 
[25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1532) upon these based on things that i've learned from other artists or from just me experimenting with this new asset right so i'm constantly updating my smart materials throwing out 
[25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1543) old ones and just continuing to build a really massive library that i can leverage so that the next time i want to create a robot it'll be much faster to texture 
[25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1554) having these already created right okay so that's going to do it for this chapter we're going to be moving into rigging and animating next uh so thanks for watching and as always i will see 
[26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz3i45sor2k&list=PL-EipzbshMbQkXb7hS0D6tKV5yfzH_6hS&index=6&t=1565) you in the next one

Blender terms and Blender vocabulary is what this tutorial is all about. 

(Description:: I've compiled dozens of Blender terms and definitions into this beginner tutorial. Have you ever been in a Blender forum or followed a Blender tutorial and heard someone casually throw out a term like "Inverse Kinematics" "Drivers" or "Normals" and were like "what is that?"  I think this video can help.)

We will cover forward and inverse kinematics, drivers, rendering, shape keys, keyframes, interpolation, tessellation, multiple importance, culling, texture baking and so much more. 

Thank you for watching and for subscribing, I am always open to feedback in the comments as well. Stay Creative!

# Transcript
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=0) This video is all about Blender vocabulary. 
Have you ever watched a Blender tutorial or   asked a question in a forum and you hear 
someone casually throw out a term like   “Inverse Kinematics” or “Driver” and you had 
no idea what they’re talking about. Hopefully,   A “mesh” in 3D software refers to the combination 
of vertices, edges and faces that form the shape   of an object. It also refers to the specific type 
of an object that uses this type of geometry.   
[00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=26) Geometry by the way is another term that simply 
describes the 3 dimensional shapes you create.   All meshes are objects, but not all objects 
are meshes. Like curves for example. Primitives are the most basic shapes 
you start with. Like planes, cubes,   spheres, cones and of course, monkey heads. Planar is an adjective that basically 
means flat or level. A four sided plane   
[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=46) will enter a Blender scene as 
planar. But if you move a vertex,   you can cause it to be non-planar. This 
is generally bad. Tris are always planar. An Ngon is a face that is 
made up of five or more sides.   Faces with four sides are called quads. 
Faces with three sides are called tris.   Faces with two sides….well….they don’t exist 
because that’s not possible. Generally “clean   
[01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=67) geometry” includes only tris and quads. Avoid 
Ngons when you can. They can cause shading issues. Proportional editing is a way to have 
the movement of selected vertices affect   unselected vertices nearby and in 
proportion based on their distance.   You turn it on with the icon up here and there 
are different ways in which the vertices can be   affected. This is called “falloff.” The shortcut 
“o” toggles proportional editting on and off.   
[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=90) And while you’re moving, rotating or scaling 
something, scrolling the middle mouse wheel up   and down changes how far the proportional 
editing will have an effect. It works in   object mode too where you can have unselected 
objects affected when you move a selected object. Rendering (the more common name for “image 
synthesis”) is the process of taking all of   the data in your scene - the objects, materials 
and lighting - and turning all of that into   
[01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=113) a 2D image. Rendering requires a “Render 
Engine” which is a computer software that   tells a computer how to render. Blender 
has three built-in render engines (well   technically four - I’ll get to that later). 
But there are many more that can be set up   with Blender. Each one calculates a little 
bit differently and at different speeds. Ray tracing is a method of calculating light 
by tracing a light’s path as it would travel in   
[02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=134) the real world. Ray tracing calculates what 
happens to a light when it hits an object.   Is it reflected, is it refracted or 
does it get absorbed by the object?   Ray tracing uses a lot of computer calculations 
and is how the Cycles render engine works.   Rendering in Eevee does not use ray tracing 
but uses a process called “Rasterization”   which does a lot more guesswork and cutting 
of corners. It’s faster but not as accurate. 
[02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=156) When you start off rendering in Cycles, you have 
a grainy image. But Blender progressively reduces   this graininess by repeatedly “sampling” 
each pixel to determine how it should look.   You can control how many attempts will 
be made at this process and each attempt   is called a “sample.” Higher samples 
have less noise but they take longer. Fireflies are those annoying bright spots 
left in a render either because not enough   
[02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=178) sampling was done or the light settings were 
too much for the render settings being used.   By the way, likes on this video - 
very much appreciated, thank you! In geometry, a normal is a direction or line that 
is perpendicular to something. In 3D software,   the “normals” represent directions of part of a 
mesh. In Blender, there are actually three types   of normals (face, vertex and split normals).
Normals also have an inside   
[03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=200) and an outside orientation.
If you want to see the normals of a mesh, go into   edit mode and go to the overlays menu. Down at 
the bottom, you can toggle the visibility of face   normals, split normals and vertex normals. And 
you can change the length of the display lines.  You can also turn on “face orientation” to see 
if you’re looking at the inside or outside of the   face. You can recalculate normals in edit mode 
by selecting your mesh and pressing “Shift+N.” 
[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=224) UV’s or UV mapping are necessary 
when you want to project an image   or material onto a 3D object. Images are 
two dimensional and in order to get them to   fit onto a 3D object, you have to do 
something known as “UV unwrapping.”   Imagine having to print the Coca 
Cola logo onto a cylindrical soda can   and having to flatten it out first to do so.
UV unwrapping is like cutting the can open   
[04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=245) and laying it out flat so you can 
get your image on it how you want.   The U and the V represent the two axes of the 
2 dimensional image because “X,” “Y,” and “Z”   are already used on the 3D object and it would 
be confusing to have two X axes and two Y axes. The pivot point is a point in 3D 
space around which all rotation,   scaling and mirroring transformations are 
centered. You can change the pivot point   
[04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=267) up here. Pivot points can be the individual 
origins of each object you’re transforming,   they can be the average between those points, or 
it could be the 3D cursor and a few other options. The term “Falloff” can be seen in different 
places. Whenever someone refers to “falloff”   they’re talking about how an effect dissipates 
either over time or distance. For example,   when using the wave modifier, the falloff is 
how far away the waves will start to die down.   
[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=290) With proportional editing, falloff is both 
how far away the verticies will be affected   and in what way that effect will be diminished. 
Most lights in Blender have falloff which is how   the light becomes weaker and weaker the farther 
you get from it. Sun lamps don’t have falloff. A spline is another name for a curve.   Curve objects are controlled with 
control points instead of vertices.   
[05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=311) The more common types of splines are bezier 
curves and nurbs curves. So spline means curve. Shading is the process of altering the color 
of an object based on its angle to lights   and distance from lights. In simple terms, it’s 
creating the look of an object’s surface - also   known as its material. You do this generally 
within the shader editor using various nodes. Whenever you see “Alpha” in materials or when 
rendering, it refers to a technique of mapping   
[05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=339) transparency and translucency. Certain file types 
like jpg’s can be rendered in RGB which means   there are red, green and blue channels. Or they 
can be RGBA. The added “A” is for Alpha. Here’s a   render with a transparent background but no alpha 
channel. Here’s the same render but with an alpha   channel that makes certain areas transparent.
You will see this in texturing and you can map   different areas of a texture to be transparent. 
So alpha always refers to transparency. 
[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=367) Ambient occlusion, or “AO” is a shadowing 
technique used to make 3D objects look more   realistic by simulating soft shadows 
where parts of the geometry touch.   It’s the shading you see right here 
where different parts come together. Baking, in general, is the act of pre-computing 
something in order to speed up some other process   later. There are different things you can 
bake in Blender. You most commonly hear of   
[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=391) baking material textures. This means you take 
all of the information like color, lighting,   roughness, ambient occlusion and more. You 
process all of that information one time   into a single image texture and it saves 
computation time later. It’s especially handy   in really big scenes, and animations or video 
games where things need to be more responsive.  You can also bake things like 
physics simulations and animations   
[06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=415) so that they don’t have to be recalculated 
on every single frame when you render. “Procedural.” When something is done procedurally,   it means it’s done through computer calculations 
based on instructions and there’s no manual   input. It’s common in materials. A procedural 
material is made up entirely of nodes mixed   together with different value inputs.
PBR materials on the other hand - PBR   
[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=438) stands for “Physically Based Rendering” - use 
images as inputs. The term “procedural” can also   be used for other things. You might hear someone 
making “procedural waves” or “procedural hair.”   It means it’s all done by entering 
values into nodes with no manual work. A render farm is a service that allows you 
to upload your 3D file and have it rendered   on someone else’s computer network, 
usually much, much faster than you   
[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=462) could do yourself. There are many render 
farms with different pricing structures.   There are also render pools that you can join 
to have your files rendered on other computers   as long as you agree to use your computer 
for rendering other people’s files. I tried   out a render farm for the first time and made and 
entire video about it if you want to check it out. Subscribe. Subscribe is not a Blender 
term, but it is what I would love for   
[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=484) you to do if you’ve made it this far and 
are enjoying the video. Thank you so much! An HDRI or HDR Image is a high-dynamic 
range image. They’re in 360 degree format   and can be placed into your world to provide 
global and more realistic lighting. Often,   they are images of skies but can also be 
interior scenes and studio light set ups.   Probably the best place to get 
free ones is from Polyhaven.com. 
[08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=509) Culling. Culling basically means that Blender 
ignores something and doesn’t display it.   You see it in a few different places. In Eevee and 
in solid view, you can turn on backface culling   which means the back of faces won’t display.
Camera culling means things outside the   camera’s view will be ignored by Blender. 
Distance culling means things beyond   a certain distance will be ignored.
So culling basically means excluding   
[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=531) or ignoring something from either 
your render or your scene in general. You’ll see the term “seed” or “seed 
value” when something can be randomized.   Basically changing the seed value gives you a 
different randomization. So, go make something   random and if you don’t like how it looks, keep 
changing the seed until you get what you want. If you see “clamp” or hear the term “clamping” 
it means to limit something to a range.   
[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=553) In the render settings under light paths, 
clamping is an option to limit the maximum   light value from a given sample - or 
calculation point - when rendering.   You would do this as a last resort 
to remove artifacts in a render.   But, you may see clamping used in other 
areas and it basically means “limiting.” This little symbol you see in 
places stands for “Fake User”   
[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=573) and in order to understand a fake user, I 
guess I should explain what a real user is.   Objects are data users when they have data from 
something like a material or node setup assigned   to them. But, when a material, for example, 
is not being used by any object in the scene,   Blender will purge it the next time it closes. 
It won’t be saved. To keep this from happening,   you can press the “Fake User” button and it’ll 
treat the material as if it’s assigned to a real   
[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=597) object so it doesn’t get deleted. It’s a strange 
thing to call it I guess, but that’s what it is. Volumetrics relates to volume, which, 
if you remember from high school math,   is the space within a 3 dimensional 
object. So, in Blender, it’s how you   want the area inside your object to be 
shaded. There are a handful of volume   shaders that allow you to give the inside of 
an object different effects like fog or smoke. 
[10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=621) Grease Pencil is the name of the 2D side of 
Blender. Grease Pencil objects are different   types of objects that allow you to draw in 3D 
space. The most basic of which are strokes. If   you open Blender, you can choose a 2D workspace 
and actually draw and animate 2 dimensionally. Freestyle is technically another rendering engine 
inside of Blender. It takes a 3D scene and uses   object information and depth to draw lines on 
selected edges. It’s a really cool way to convert   
[10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=647) a 3D scene into 2D line art and you can change a 
lot of settings to get different stroke effects. Pressure Sensitivity is what this symbol 
means and whenever you see it, it means that   the value can be controlled dynamically with a 
pressure-sensitive drawing tablet. When you’re   using a drawing tablet and have this box checked, 
that means the harder you press down on the pen,   the more this value will be added. You can use it 
for strength, radius, opacity and other things in   
[11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=671) Blender. If you’re interested in a drawing tablet, 
I will link to the one I use in the description. Constraints are a way of controlling or limiting 
an object, often with data from another object.   You add constraints to objects from the object 
constraints tab in the properties panels.   For example, you could have one 
object’s transformation copy another’s   or you could limit an object’s 
movement to a path or a curve. 
[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=695) Modifiers are things that you add 
to objects for some sort of effect   but that work non-destructively. Meaning they 
don’t affect the original data of the object and   can be removed or changed later. You add modifiers 
from the modifiers tab in the properties panel.   There are over 50 modifiers and 
each one does something different.   The mirror modifier causes an object’s 
geometry to be mirrored. The curve modifier   
[11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=717) allows you to bend objects along a curve. 
So many things you can do with modifiers. Particle Systems are a technique to simulate 
certain things that you need lots and lots   of in your scene - without manually placing 
each one. You can add a particle system to   an object in the particle settings tab found in 
the properties panel. Common uses include leaves,   strands of hair or fur, falling snow, 
scattered debris, sparks. You get the   
[12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=741) picture. Each individual item created in 
a particle system is known as a particle. Instancing is a way of creating a copy 
of something but using the data from   the original object. You may hear something 
is an “instance” or an “instanced object.”   It’s a more efficient way of duplicating something 
because it doesn’t really add new data to a scene.   An instanced copy basically tells Blender “I am an 
object but to see what object I’m supposed to be,   
[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=766) refer to this other object.” Instancing occurs 
when you make a linked duplicate, when you make an   array, when you make a collection instance, a 
particle system and in a lot of other areas. Parenting. One object can be parented to 
another which means it follows the object   and is transformed when the parent 
object is transformed. The object   being parented to a parent object 
is known as the “child object” or   
[13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=789) children. Bones are also often parented to 
other bones to create a rigged armature. Motion Blur is an effect that occurs in cameras 
- both in still images and in video - where   fast moving objects appear blurry. By default, 
Blender renders everything as a perfectly still   scene. But, this doesn’t look realistic when 
you have objects that are moving very fast.   So, Blender allows you to 
add motion blur to a scene. 
[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=813) Depth of Field is a very important concept in 
photography. Even if you don’t know what it is,   you’ve probably noticed the 
effect in pictures or movies.   Cameras focus on objects at a certain distance 
range and objects outside of that range - either   closer or farther away - appear blurry. How 
blurry they appear can be adjusted in cameras   by increments called “F-Stops” and the entire 
effect can be simulated in Blender cameras too.   
[13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=836) Adding Depth of Field or DOF 
to a scene is a great effect. Caustics are those light effects you see in real 
life when light touches glass or water. In many 3D   softwares - including Blender - you can include 
them in the calculation of your renders. There   are actually two types of caustics: reflective 
and refractive. They can be turned on or off   by going to render properties and expanding the 
light paths tab. They can be pretty draining on   
[14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=860) render computations so turn them off if you don’t 
need them to save on render times and memory. IOR stands for “Index of Refraction” and it’s a 
property of transparent and translucent materials.   When light rays move from one medium to another, 
they bend. The IOR relates to the angle at   which the light bends and can be set when adding 
transparent or translucent elements to a material.   Many materials such as water, 
ice and various types of glass   
[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=886) have known IOR’s you can look up and set them 
to match the material you’re trying to create. MatCap. MatCap is short for “Material 
Capture.” It’s a method of faking materials,   lighting and reflections across your 
entire scene using just a single image.   They’re usually used for previews and 
can be accessed here in preview mode.   You can create or download your own and 
you can add them in the preferences.   
[15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=909) You can actually render these out using the 
workbench render engine too. So these are MatCaps. Drivers are math functions that can change 
the characteristic of something based on the   characteristic of something else. For example, you 
could create a driver that causes the rotation of   an object to be driven by the movement of 
another object. The more the second object   moves the more the first object rotates. 
You can add mathematical functions so you   
[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=934) could say that for every x amount of movement 
by one object, the other object will rotate y   amount. Math is confusing but if you hear people 
talking about drivers, this is what they mean. A vertex group is a collection of vertices 
from your object. These are used when you   want to tell Blender to limit an operation 
to only part of your mesh. Maybe to say where   you want hair or grass to grow on an object or 
what part of an object should be affected when   
[15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=958) a certain bone is moved. You can create them 
by going to the object data properties panel,   adding a new vertex group and then 
assigning vertices to that group. Weight Painting is a process of giving 
vertices within a vertex group a weight   value between zero and one. These weights 
can be used for different things later.   Like density maps for particle systems or to 
tell bones how much to affect parts of a mesh.   
[16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=981) You can paint these weight values in 
weight paint mode. Blue is no weight,   red is full weight and the other 
colors are somewhere in between. Voxel is the cubic, 3D equivalent 
of the square 2D pixel. The word is   a combination of “volume” and “pixel.” 
Physics simulations use voxels to store   smoke and fire data. It’s also become a 
fairly popular style of art. Thanks Minecraft. 
[16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1004) Subsurface Scattering or “SSS” is an effect 
that occurs when light passes through an object   and then scatters underneath it. The best example 
is human skin. The pinkish hue from skin is caused   by light penetrating the skin and scattering under 
the surface. So it’s called subsurface scattering.   You can give materials subsurface scattering in 
Blender to mimic this effect for more realism. In animation, keyframes are used to tell Blender 
“this is how something should be at this frame”   
[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1031) and “this is how something should be 
at this frame.” Blender, I need you   to figure out what happens in between. To 
animate this cube moving across the screen,   we don’t tell Blender where it needs to 
be at every single frame. We set a start   and end keyframe and it figures out the 
rest - a process known as interpolation. Interpolation is the filling in of frames between 
two keyframes. For example, if a keyframe is set   
[17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1053) for this cube here on frame 1 and then over 
here on frame 50, Blender will interpolate   the movement of the cube over the 50 frames.
In the timeline, graph editor or dope sheet,   you can change how Blender interpolates. By 
default, Blender uses a “bezier” interpolation   so the cube starts moving slowly, speeds up 
and then slows down as it stops. Pressing “T”   in any of the animation editors will 
give you different interpolation options.   
[17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1078) Linear means the speed will remain 
the same throughout the animation. An “F-Curve” is a curve that holds the 
animation values of a specific property.   In the graph editor, you can view the f-curves 
of properties you have animated. As this cube   moves up and then back down, its movement along 
the “Z” axis is represented in this f-curve. Nonlinear Animation. Nonlinear animation 
is an animation technique that allows you   
[18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1103) to edit motions as a whole and not just 
as individual key frames. You basically   save a series of keyframes as an action 
and in the non-linear animation editor   (NLA editor for short), you can move those 
actions around, change their speed and blend   them together. Nonlinear animation is 
an advanced and powerful way to animate. Shape Keys are an animation tool that 
allows you to deform a mesh object.   
[18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1127) They may also be referred to as “morph 
targets” or “blend shapes” in other software.   When you add a shape key, you add a basis 
shape for the mesh. Then you can add multiple   deformations of that mesh and animate between 
them. I have a video on shape keys for more. Mathematically, a vector is an object with 
both magnitude and direction. You’ll see the   term vector in Blender and a vector always 
has three values representing the X, Y and   
[19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1151) Z axes. They’re used to denote the location of 
something in 3D space or directional information. Kinematics is a mechanical term referring to 
the movement of objects and in Blender it’s   used to describe how parented objects, or more 
commonly bones, move. Forward Kinematics is when   a parented bone controls its child bone. Inverse 
Kinematics is when child bones actually control   how the parent bones move. Here’s an example. 
This leg is set up with forward kinematics.   
[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1179) Moving the thigh moves all the bones below 
it. If I move the foot, it does not affect   the upper portions of the leg.
However, this rig is set up with   inverse kinematics. With this, I move the 
foot and the rest of the leg follows. The   control is inverted. Both forward kinematics 
and inverse kinematics have their uses. A cryptomatte is a feature in Blender 
that allows you to isolate objects   
[20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1202) and materials in the compositor. You have to 
have it turned on in the render passes section.   But after you render, it can mask 
objects or materials in your image   allowing you to make color adjustments 
on individual objects or by material. Tessellation is the tiling of a plane 
using one or more geometric shapes.   It basically means replacing 
a face with another object.   
[20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1223) The tissue tools add-on allows you to 
tessellate. You can tell the addon to replace   every face of one object with an instance 
of another object. That’s tessellation. “Multiple Importance” is still confusing even 
to me, but when using a ray-trace render engine   like Cycles, it’s an option to have rays 
sent directly toward the emissive materials   instead of randomly finding them. In short, 
sometimes using this method can reduce noise,   
[20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFIhfF_5cdE&t=1247) but it can also reduce lighting from 
other areas of your scene and the only   recommendations I can find is try it on 
a render and see if it’s better or not.

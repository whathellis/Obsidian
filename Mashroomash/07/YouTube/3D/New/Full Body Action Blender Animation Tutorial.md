[00:00](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=0) [Music] foreign [Music] welcome to this full body action Sean my name is Alex and I'm using the bakir 
[00:18](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=18) character rig from Agora websites I'm going to leave a link in the description to the ring this video is all about body mechanics how to set it up and take the scene to completion there are two main 
[00:29](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=29) principles of Animation that we'll be using for this exercise posing and timing we'll talk about those as we block out the scene another important principle that is underrated is staging 
[00:40](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=40) we'll look at staging now as we set up the scene together here's what we have going on in the scene we have book here and we have two platforms one that he's standing on and 
[00:51](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=51) then this Gap that he's going to jump over and then this landing area so that's what's going on in the scene nice and simple but here this rig is a a new rig to me so I'll be discovering it a 
[01:02](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=62) little bit in this demonstration let's talk a little bit about staging now so we have a better idea what goes into it to me there are three aspects of staging the first and the most common one is the 
[01:13](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=73) relationship of objects to each other so in this case this character in relationship to this platform in relationship to this other platform in the Gap really it's your character in 
[01:23](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=83) relationship to the set and the main elements in that set the other two aspects of staging that I've come to group all under staging is framing once we have the character in the right spot 
[01:35](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=95) and we understand what the action is going to be is we have to start to think about the different cameras we're going to place is it one camera two cameras five cameras and are the cameras 
[01:44](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=104) stationary or moving we start to build a little blueprint in our mind of what the scene could be so in this scene I'm going to have a cure antic back take a big step forward jump over this cap and 
[01:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=115) roll and I'm thinking two shots is what I need to tell the story the first shot is going to be a full body something where we can show off our action he's going to exit screen I might even pull 
[02:04](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=124) the camera back a little bit see the character or I might even make it three shots just show um the over the shoulder show what's Happening as an establishing shot cut to 
[02:14](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=134) the front full body so we can see our action I'll leave a little Gap here so we understand he's jumping over and then the third shot I'm thinking is nice on the other platform already see the 
[02:25](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=145) finishing of the action jumping through there Landing rolling and ending up in a very nice close-up in the camera and then taking off maybe three shots is what we'll do for this scene together so 
[02:36](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=156) we talked about two aspects of staging the relationship of objects to each other the framing and the last aspect that I put under staging is composition once I've decided what the framing is 
[02:47](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=167) and what I want to show and not show the viewer I work within that framing now and compose different elements of the picture to direct the viewer's eye or to make things more clear so composition to 
[02:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=178) me also lands under the principle of staging let's start blocking out our scene before I do note that I'm in the animation workspace I find that very 
[03:06](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=186) useful I have my three Windows this left panel this right one and then the graph editor once you're in the animation workspace if you don't see the graph editor you can either control tab to 
[03:18](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=198) swap between the dope sheet and the graph editor or you can come to this corner and go graph editor the timeline typically is like this so I just pull it 
[03:27](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=207) up I'm not going to use the properties for now so I'm just going to pull that this way in the right panel here what I like to do is just turn these things off so I'm only focusing on the picture 
[03:38](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=218) itself and then on the left side I'll turn everything on so I can work with my ring I'm going to select the rig control tab takes me to pose mode a to select all and I'm going to frame for it I've 
[03:50](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=230) started with a very simple pose for our character and basically is just looking across the Gap like I said before I think the best framing for a shot is just this over the shoulder something 
[03:59](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=239) simple that allows everyone to understand what the what the scene's about and it's about this character overlooking this cap so I'm just going to go ahead and set that first camera 
[04:07](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=247) then work on the next camera and start blocking the scene so actually yeah let's go out of pose mode I'm going to go shift a and let's create a camera camera over 
[04:17](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=257) here in this window I'm going to hit zero on a numpad and that takes us into this camera view I'm just going to frame in a little bit so I'm going to make my framing window larger I'm going to hit n 
[04:27](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=267) this property under View Camera to view I'm going to click that on and now what I can do is frame out of this window that's very powerful pull this properties a little bit I have my camera 
[04:37](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=277) selected and under viewport display this passport out I'm going to just go 0.99 this allows us to focus in on our framing yet still see elements of the set outside this framing area what I 
[04:51](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=291) like about framing in this window is I can select any object here or even here you just I just don't see it but you can see I still select it then I can hit after frame for it takes you right there 
[05:01](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=301) nice and quick for this first framing all I'm thinking is screen Direction and just trying to show things as clearly as possible so screen direction is this character standing and I'm on the right 
[05:13](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=313) side of this character so when I cut I'll still be on the right side of this character this character is always going to be looking screen left to right doesn't matter if I'm in front or behind 
[05:24](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=324) him this character is always looking in that one screen Direction so I'll maintain that throughout okay something like this I can always change it after cool I like that the character is in 
[05:34](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=334) this nice negative space here and I'm leaving a nice Gap here for screen Direction I'm just going to go back to n turn off this camera to view so now I can't accidentally bump it I can always 
[05:46](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=346) go back with zero on the numpad and here's that camera I'm going to select it I'm going to go to frame one and I'm just thinking now how long the shot should be and probably about a second 
[05:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=355) maybe a second in a bit so seconds 24 frames so let me give it a second and a third so I'm going to go to frame 32 and I think that's a good amount of time so I'm just going 
[06:07](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=367) to hit I and that sets a key you saw that when I hit I don't get that menu and how that happens is if I go over here I have to be in object mode to do that go to object 
[06:17](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=377) animation and change the key set once I do that I can pick what I want and I leave it at location rotation and every time I hit I it's always going to key those two things so I select my camera I 
[06:28](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=388) hit I sets a keyframe there I'm also going to just key my my focal length I'm actually going to widen it out a little bit 35 and by widening My Lens all I'm doing is making that Gap feel wider just 
[06:40](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=400) with affecting that focal length I'm going to have a little bit of a crane up move just to add a little bit of Parallax Parallax just helps to find different depths so I'm going to hit n 
[06:49](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=409) one more time just come out of this framing window let's hit I to update that location rotation perfect let's come over to our next frame frame 33 and let's already frame for the next shot 
[07:01](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=421) so I'm going to select that character hit f and I'm going to frame for that character nice hero upshot I do want to see the 
[07:10](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=430) foot plans so I'm not going to be underneath that platform so I can't see anything I like seeing a little bit of the Gap there and what this character is I'm going to over the cut I'm going to 
[07:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=439) move this character a little bit more screen left so I have more more distance to play with here I'm leaving enough Gap here so we can show that jump out of frame I'm going to hit n one more time 
[07:32](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=452) get out of this camera view so again now I can't bump the camera select the camera and you can select the camera from the view or from your outliner here 
[07:43](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=463) cool hit I to insert a key you saw that update here and let's adjust our end framing for now I'll just make it 60 frames and without having laid a key on our character or at least any animation 
[07:54](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=474) let's see if the story is communicating so we have that first shot we have the second shot cool so I like it I think what I'll do is I'll 
[08:10](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=490) actually frame a little tighter on this first shot there so then when we come to the second shot it's a little wider the contrast is greater so that's the only change I'll make I'm going to select the 
[08:20](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=500) camera I'm just going to actually yeah increase that focal length a little bit not much just cutting off the body a little bit awesome and let's go ahead and add a little bit of a camera move 
[08:30](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=510) and then we can start blocking our character I to insert a key coming over here frame 32 and I'm just going to pull it up just a little bit insert a key and I'm also 
[08:40](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=520) going to pan down while I crane up just a little bit insert a key I I might go back to the beginning and also just pushing closer to our character so what that camera 
[08:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=535) move is doing is not only craning up and panning down but I'm also pulling out adding more than one direction on a camera move can help with depth so that's what I'm doing there by pulling 
[09:04](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=544) the camera back as well with the camera selected I'm going to hit a select my keyframes period numpad just frame for it a to select all my keyframes in here and I'm going to go V and make that 
[09:14](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=554) Vector make that linear so let's go ahead and watch that now cool so we we see the Gap a little more and it could probably use another eight 
[09:24](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=564) frames just just so um the shot doesn't cut too quickly but I'll leave it for now let's start blocking our character I'm going to 
[09:33](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=573) select the rig um control tab I'm in pose mode now a to select all so when we cut to a new shot typically you want to give about eight frames one third of a second just so the 
[09:45](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=585) viewer has enough time to gather new information and then we can start presenting additional information on top of that so we cut to this new shot on frame 33 here I'm going to give six 
[09:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=598) to eight frames of nothing there might be a little camera drift or whatever but in terms of movement on the character I'm going to give a little pause and then start my animation 
[10:09](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=609) so I'm going to start maybe on frame 39 I'm going to lay a key there I to insert a key okay I've selected the character's rudol I'm just going to pull 
[10:22](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=622) him back a little and maybe a little more screen left really giving myself more screen real estate to play with I might have a little bit of a camera pull out maybe a 
[10:32](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=632) pan as the action happens I'm not sure yet but just giving myself enough distance here that I can imagine a little antic back kind of a big little Leap Forward a big 
[10:42](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=642) anticipation here and then that stretch forward insert a key and let's start posing so I'm going to go to frame 39 insert a key again so all this is is 
[10:52](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=652) frame 33 is a keyframe it's just a physical change in location from the move all or on the move all and now this is a hold and now I'm going to start that 
[11:03](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=663) anticipation so I'm on frame 39 typically a move is either six frames eight frames uh 10 frames 12 frames I keep my keyframes evenly spaced so for the sanctic let's 
[11:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=679) go eight frames here insert a key and now I'm going to start to affect this pose and really what the post change is he's down here observing and he's just going to come back a 
[11:28](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=688) little bit building building that tension so then we can go in the direction we want so let's do that together I'm going to pull this leg back 
[11:40](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=700) and we're just going to start posing that idea and at the beginning I think moving quickly just to see if your idea is working is better 
[11:49](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=709) so I'm not going to spend too much time on each pose and then I'm going to see how it plays together and then I'm going to go back refine the pose and then refine the 
[11:56](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=716) timing and everything else so here's that antic back nice and simple for now I'm going to spend more time on this second pose here but let's keep going let's keep going and seeing if our idea 
[12:08](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=728) is is working so we're going from one idea one pose I like to call my poses typically ideas or even my framings ideas because what I'm doing when I'm saying an idea is I'm 
[12:20](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=740) communicating something to the audience this pose this framing is an idea by moving my pose by changing the pose I'm inserting a new idea and 
[12:34](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=754) I find that when you're creating shots from scratch or even if you're following storyboards or anything what you're doing is you're communicating an idea and typically a 
[12:44](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=764) shot has one idea in this case this shot the only purpose of this shot is to have that character jump out of frame that's the idea that's the point of the shot 
[12:54](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=774) and the more information I put into the shot um I have to make sure that it's communicating that one idea this 
[13:03](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=783) character is jumping out of this this shot and um and then this idea within the greater span of the shot is in anticipation am I selling the idea that 
[13:14](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=794) this body this character is trying to is trying to build some tension to go the other way so that's why I call to me everything is an idea this pose change am I communicating the right idea so 
[13:26](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=806) you'll see me go back and forth between those two words posing idea framing idea I'm going to insert a key so I'm going from one pose to another one idea to another and then I need to hold I need a 
[13:39](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=819) little bit of a hold and in that time we're going to have a settle this hole just allows the viewer to see your idea your your posing so we can read it and all this is is six 
[13:51](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=831) frames right here and then we're going to go into another movement another idea okay so and then you can see once I refine the pose I'm just going to copy it to 
[14:01](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=841) the other one and then I'm going to work on my breakdown Keys then the saddle into this last key here we have the beginnings of an anticipation now we got to start going forward now what I'm 
[14:13](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=853) doing is I'm going to go I'm going to switch up my workflow a little bit and work straight ahead so here over these two keyframes I was just going post to pose one idea to another now I'm still 
[14:23](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=863) doing that one idea to another but I'm working straight ahead it's going to be easier to get that character into that squash and out so let's do that together and see what that looks like I'm on 
[14:33](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=873) frame 53 I'm going to go to frame 61. eight frames and start moving my character forward he's going to take a little bit of a step forward here and I'm going to be nice and rough again 
[14:45](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=885) it's more is everything working together and when I when I pose things definitely the CLG usually is the the control that's working the hardest and even on a small move I'll move the 
[14:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=898) Cog because you can see when I move the Cog it moves everything in the body so even on a small post change I'll move the Cog a little bit that ensures every part of the body has a bit of movement 
[15:09](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=909) then I can focus in on other parts of the body that need um that need attention for that pose change but the Cog always has a little bit of 
[15:20](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=920) movement at least okay we have this antique he's holding he's going to come forward and already that forward boom and I want to come a bit lower just by scrubbing I can see 
[15:31](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=931) I can see the path so I'm just going to come forward more back and down he's building a little bit of antic even again and now I'm going to go four frames 
[15:42](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=942) insert a key I'm going to be very rough at this stage he pushes off that leg something like this this leg is now going to come off 
[15:57](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=957) come on and I'm just being very rough about my blocking you can see how strange it might even look cool and so the key on everything I 
[16:08](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=968) insert a key on everything all the time well not all the time but it when I'm blocking I'll select everything insert a key okay let's go four more frames 
[16:20](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=980) here to select all another nice reason for just kind of the straight ahead is I find it a little more organic as well um working rough and straight ahead to 
[16:33](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=993) build some action sometimes okay let's again pull that Cog and now um now he's going to start to contact this other main jumping off spot I'm thinking 
[16:44](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1004) about so my posing I'm also thinking about spacing but in a rough way spacing is just the distance between the controls or the different body parts over time the nice 
[16:57](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1017) thing about working rough is you haven't committed much time so if it's not something that's working for you you don't feel like you've sunk an hour into your work or two hours and then the 
[17:07](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1027) idea of redoing it is harder to swallow so working rough and maybe spending eight minutes ten minutes blocking out a whole action seeing if it has if it's valid 
[17:21](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1041) is a better use of your time oh come on come on cool by now these arms are going to start to swing back and you can see even though I'm laying Keys pretty close to 
[17:36](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1056) each other once I go back in if one of the keys this middle one isn't working for my arms I can delete those and we work on them we work the arc so that's why I'm not too precious but here I can 
[17:48](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1068) I can already tell that the arms are going to start to swing back in preparation for that that final anticipation four more frames 73 and this is my main 
[18:01](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1081) contact pose now this leg is going to go on the ground so what I'm going to do is alt R reset the rotation and ALT G just sits on the ground poop and I'll slide it forward 
[18:14](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1094) cool I'm going to get this leg close to the platform or the edge of the platform this is going to be the leg that's really going to push off at the end I'm going to alt R I like to reset 
[18:27](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1107) values quite a bit sometimes especially over bigger pose changes and thinking about it now maybe the opposite leg would have been nice so um his back leg his left leg to be 
[18:42](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1122) forward right leg to be back just so we get a better silhouette from this angle but all that tells me is maybe I'll change the camera I'm not going to go ahead and change the pose it's easier to 
[18:53](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1133) change the camera I've committed to my pose for now because I don't want to go back but you can see from this angle this leg is blocking the back leg by orbiting the camera even a little bit 
[19:05](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1145) we get that silhouette so that's an easy fix there so but I'm aware of it just even at this stage looking it looking at it from this camera angle and now I'm going to spend 
[19:15](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1155) a little more time on this pose this pose is important nice and rough I'm going to move this leg I'm not worried about that it might slip from the other one because I'll 
[19:26](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1166) affect that other keyframe like that this this this Frame really is important so let's take a look here I want a nice C curve that's the goal here A C curve so when I go into that 
[19:40](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1180) next pose it's a nice straight pose and that contrast is going to look good and then we just play with the timing once we have two nice poses to work with I'm going to select the camera hit f 
[19:53](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1193) and even maybe coming more forward on the line is nice already that that looks better so I'm going to do that I was thinking I'd do more profile and profile could be cool 
[20:06](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1206) yeah profile could be actually really cool because we're going to see that action more clearly nice profile angle and then when we cut 
[20:15](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1215) to the third one we can be more on the line and that'll be a nice change instead of being on the line here although I like that 
[20:27](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1227) jumping out and essentially just pulling back um yeah let's keep it profile for now this Gap is is definitely 
[20:43](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1243) um exaggerated just by seeing this empty space so I look I like that better okay let's do that what we've done up to this point is we've added two cameras and we're starting to block the 
[20:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1255) character's action and just even at this stage I feel like the story is going to work the idea the block and the physicality is going to work so without even committing now to the third shot I 
[21:05](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1265) have an idea what the third shot's going to be what the action is going to look like um but I'm gonna just refine the blocking 
[21:13](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1273) of this action first and then the jump out before I move to the third Sean so I have everything selected a to select all insert a key and let's refine the pose and I have this pose here it's the same 
[21:24](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1284) it's just a hold just going to come over one frame insert a key what I'm going to do now with these two keys is I'm going to refine one of them refine the pose and improve it any which way mainly for 
[21:37](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1297) clarity is it selling whatever idea I want to sell in this case him just looking at the Gap and hopefully looking a little heroic so I'm going to work on that idea refine 
[21:48](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1308) the pose and then I'm going to flip back and forth between these two ideas these two poses and if this pose is better keep this one delete this one or just replace it so 
[22:01](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1321) pull him forward a little bit and I really like that and this Gap can increase a little bit and maybe what I'll even do is have the back 
[22:12](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1332) foot more on its toes like he's really looking at how big that Gap is cool I'm going to select my spine controls here cool so I've already added some values 
[22:28](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1348) there I'm going to just pull that chest back a little bit awesome and then the head as well Just Gonna Have It do I want to look down 
[22:47](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1367) and don't be afraid to translate controls as well just because our bones can't physically translate they can pivot they can rotate but don't be afraid especially for shoulders when you 
[22:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1378) need to especially the back shoulder that's not viewed from that camera angle you can really pull that shoulder back rotate it so then you get that nice silhouette from that angle on certain 
[23:08](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1388) parts of the body so hopefully your character rig is able to translate this is all I'm doing is we're finding the idea so I've done the blocking pass I now know it's 
[23:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1399) working now I'm going to clean up the poses so I might speed through this part you can just see the the time lapse essentially but all I'm doing is refining the poses 
[23:28](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1408) at this point cleaning up those ideas cool so I've just cleaned up my my pose a little bit and here's what I'm going to do use my arrow key and you can see just going back and 
[23:51](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1431) forth between those two poses and already one is stronger this was my original this is the updated one it's stronger because it's more clear 
[24:03](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1443) okay so I'm selecting a inserting a key on all and all I'm doing now is copying that key Ctrl C TRL V 
[24:13](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1453) and again now I can refine it even more so you can see how long posing can take but when you block it I think in the way that I was doing at the beginning is I spent five minutes on about six seven 
[24:26](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1466) eight posts or something like that are they working together so I'm going to leave that pose where it is I'm not going to spend more time on that now okay so let's also paste it to this 
[24:37](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1477) keyframe here and I'll delete this one now just like I did over here all I'm going to do now is go to this pose copy this pose paste this pose and I will find it just 
[24:49](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1489) like I did for here so again a bit of a time lapse here all right so I refined this anticipation pose and here's what it looks like so it's a little cleaner than before and 
[25:45](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1545) that's the whole idea the idea is working now can we make it stronger so here's what that looks like just flipping between them if you hit up and down on your arrows 
[25:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1555) you go from keyframe keyframe if you go left and right you just go frame by frame so the next pose I'm going to work on is that final anticipation this one is really important this one I really 
[26:08](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1568) want to exaggerate and then I'll refine these little ones as I go like I said these other ones aren't important these ones really what's important about these poses I'll refine the the Silhouettes 
[26:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1579) and everything but it's the movement it's the arc it's the timing that's more important about these uh poses here as we move through the movement but the the pose that we land on that's 
[26:31](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1591) the one we're going to refine let's do this one together I'm going to hit a select all insert a key just to make sure and I go over one frame and all I'm 
[26:41](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1601) doing is um copying that pose now I have something even if I ever mess this pose up basically I save a copy but if I improve 
[26:51](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1611) the pose then I replace it Okay so you can just have a look at the action the hands are by the side he's looking over I'm leaning back hands are forward and by the time I come in over here I really 
[27:05](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1625) want the hands up in this negative space I want those hands looking like they're just about to swing forward and really help propel them forward so I know I want that look 
[27:16](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1636) I want a stronger shape visually in the legs and I really want that curve in the back and the spine and then as for the head I'm going to have it looking straight forward that's where 
[27:29](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1649) he's jumping and maybe even the tail the tail I'll leave for a second pass after I'm done with everything but I can even imagine the tail may be curling up somehow and 
[27:38](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1658) also looking like it's holding tension when you have an idea in your head like I said this one I I know I want the hands here I'm not sure quite how I'm going to do it but they have to be there 
[27:49](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1669) because I think it's going to be stronger so don't be shy about it and just do it just be like Boop just pose it in those ideas 
[27:59](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1679) and while you're doing it you're thinking about okay I'm crashing I'm doing this how am I getting in that shape but the idea is more important than 
[28:09](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1689) right now um how it's hooking up you're thinking about how it's hooking up so you don't get any gimbal lock or any weird rotations you're thinking about that 
[28:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1699) but like I said the idea is more important than not doing it so you can see how aggressive I'm being with the shoulders and at this distance and the cloth material the fabric you 
[28:31](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1711) just don't see that tearing so that's why I'm not shy about it okay and I'm I'm probably going to move those papers out of the way this hand's too high I can see it being in this area 
[28:45](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1725) that shoulder really plays such an important part and having that hand in the screen space that I wanted cool I'm getting where I want to so 
[29:00](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1740) that's better right now leave it for now I'm going to think about that that spine as well so I work on one spot get it to roughly where I want and I work on different aspects of the body that to me 
[29:11](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1751) are important and I kind of refine them all at once instead of focusing in this case on the one arm and then what if I make changes to the spine or the legs all of a sudden that one arm I spent 
[29:22](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1762) maybe 10 minutes on isn't working with the rest of the body so I I move something in the direction it needs to and I refine other key areas of the body so that it's all working together 
[29:36](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1776) um so I'm really I really want a nice C curve and then I like how low he is to the ground this hip control plays a a big role so you can see if I rotate it here it kind 
[29:48](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1788) of breaks that c that shape so I know I'm going to roll it down this way and I feel like it also has to come back out and then the legs I think can have much 
[30:08](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1808) greater separation as well maybe not much greater but just a little more maybe you almost don't even see any Gap that's how compressed our character is 
[30:25](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1825) oh that's nice too and then he'll come forward so just building that that energy storing that energy in this in this pose 
[30:43](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1843) same with the head I can just pull it back a little bit I don't like to zoom in that close to my character if I know my shot is this far away 
[30:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1858) I don't like to zoom in too close and worry about things that just won't be seen from that angle so I'll zoom in a little bit but that's why I don't go too close I like 
[31:08](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1868) to see it at about the framing that I'm gonna that the viewer is gonna see it at you know hit a select all insert a key and now we can look at the two poses for that for 
[31:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1879) that antic pose into the jump and so this one is better this one feels like he's throwing more energy so I like that idea I'm going to copy this Ctrl C TRL V 
[31:31](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1891) so I'll keep doing that a couple times and then what I can do as well is I'll move this keyframe over now select these two I and go automatic and you can see now I can use the computer you can see 
[31:43](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1903) how the computer elongates the shape a little bit what's happening here is the information from this keyframe goes into this one and it overshoots you can see 
[31:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1915) you can see this curve here overshooting and coming back so I use that information as well first I like to refine my pose as much as I can then I'll duplicate my pose Auto or yes Auto 
[32:07](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1927) spline between them and then use what the computer gives me as well and all just to refine that pose that idea cool so here's what we have so far we've worked on three poses that first initial 
[32:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1939) standing pose that antic back and then that last compression pose where he's about to jump forward so we refine those three poses and we have about four poses in between as well 
[32:29](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1949) helping to find the action what I'm going to do now is work on that next extreme pose where he's stretching to jump and then we'll work on the exit then we'll go back and start adding some 
[32:40](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1960) breakdown keys we're going to have a small little settle here so as we come in here we're going to have a saddle it might only be two frames until we start to move into the next next key so a to 
[32:53](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1973) select all insert a key I'm just going to go two frames for now insert a key I'm going to go to uh four frames over now from 75 I'm going to go to 79 
[33:03](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1983) insert a key and work on that stretch so now I've spent Maybe good five minutes eight minutes on this pose and now I'm gonna spend 30 seconds a 
[33:15](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=1995) minute on the the stretch pose see if that idea is working and then again I'll refine it okay so these are going to be the most too extreme poses the change between them is the most 
[33:25](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2005) extreme so I'm Really Gonna help that along you can see I'm pulling that Cog usually I start there and now what I'm going to 
[33:34](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2014) do is just reset some of these values I've selected this the the hip control and the spine controls here in blender you can do alt R alt G just to reset it in Maya you can just go over 
[33:47](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2027) to your attributes and reset the values or use your picker let's do the same for the head just reset the values and let's do the same basically for most of the body parts so this foot was the last one 
[33:59](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2039) on the ground this foot can start to come up so I'm just going to also start to pose that and when we jump forward we have our arms that swing forward that help the 
[34:18](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2058) momentum go forward we have the push of the legs um but then the leg itself can also swing forward a little bit as well so this one that's going to leave the 
[34:27](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2067) ground first is going to start to come up a little bit that's the idea I'm not too worried about the details yet 
[34:42](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2082) so it is going to work it is looking good and I do want even more stretch than what I have now so um I'll do that but for now I'll keep it as is give 
[34:53](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2093) myself a little more time here cool and we'll just get him out of the shot I think I want even just a tad higher cool 
[35:18](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2118) 79 and then maybe six frames here just to get them fully out insert a key and I'm just going to grab the foot control foot control COG 
[35:30](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2130) and pull them out a little bit affect the shape a little bit so here he's going to start to rotate over a little bit I think we can still get a little more height 
[35:47](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2147) and we'll straighten these legs out a bit cool and maybe what I'll do when I do clean up this idea is working six frames my 
[36:11](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2171) spacing to be six frames I don't like that as much because that means the middle is three frames I like to work on even so I set my keyframes on odd numbers 
[36:21](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2181) and my spacing is even but I like to go two frames four frames eight frames and right now it's six frames um so when I go back in I'll probably like 
[36:34](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2194) here on 83 it's just easier for me to space out that way but let's just do 89 for now and I'm just working rough awesome so it's nice to see 
[36:45](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2205) um basically the blocking blocking of um of this idea of this shot this might be a good place to show um if you're working in a production to 
[36:56](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2216) show someone hey is this idea working this is a good first pass just to submit get it in the cut and and see if it's working get some notes before you commit more time 
[37:07](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2227) cool so it is working now let's go in and refine things even more and start adding the breakdowns and finish up this animation I'll finish up this shot we'll 
[37:17](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2237) go into the third one and um and then I'll probably make that video or that portion of the video a little quicker but it's basically the same thing we're doing here the more complex thing and 
[37:29](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2249) I'll spend a bit of time in that one the more complex aspect of the third shot is going to be the rule you'll see how how I go about that I'll just be brutal about it pose 
[37:40](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2260) kind of like we did here pose coming into that Landing the role being very brutal about it and and then spending a lot of time on that that final pose but everything in between 
[37:53](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2273) there those six eight frames are going to happen quick I'm not worried about crashing that much just worried about the movement and if it's working altogether 
[38:03](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2283) okay so let's do some breakdown Keys here's what we're going to do we're back at the start of the second shot and we're going to do a breakdown and settle together 
[38:11](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2291) basically it's just a simple formula pose pose you're gonna have some breakdown keys and then you're gonna add a saddle and then same thing in here uh pose pose 
[38:23](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2303) the only difference is now you're not going to have a settle because it's moving between keyframes but you're still going to have some breakdown keys okay 
[38:32](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2312) so we have an idea frame 39 eight frames later on for 47 we have the next idea in between here we're going to add some keys on 
[38:45](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2325) different parts of the body to Define some of the arc And Delay some of that action and you'll see as we get closer to the Head typically the head's more important we're going to add a little 
[38:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2335) more movement on the head and put the breakdown key closer to the end of the action that way when it comes into the saddle the portion on the whole body the head 
[39:06](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2346) portion is going to have the most movement and by having the most movement your eye is drawn to that part of the body let's start with the Cog select the Cog come 
[39:15](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2355) on and for the Cog right in the middle here is 43 I might come sometimes a little before that or right on 43. one important thing too in this action 
[39:27](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2367) that you can see is we have both feet moving this back foot is going to be the more important one as it's being planted but this front foot is also moving so before 
[39:38](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2378) we do the Cog let's just take care of that I'm going to copy this Ctrl C may become three frames over Ctrl V that foot is going to stay planted on the ground we can't have both feet moving at 
[39:49](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2389) the same time maybe even four frames so it's planted on the ground and then it's going to come up this foot is the opposite 
[40:00](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2400) instead of delaying it we're actually going to have it come into its pose sooner so what I'm doing is Ctrl C copying this pose it may be coming four frames 
[40:10](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2410) and Ctrl V so now it's planted on the ground you can see each leg moves at its own timing and then we can refine that but that's important when you have a pose change 
[40:24](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2424) and you have two feet moving that's okay they just got a something's going to be planted in order to allow us to push off and take the weight okay let's go back to our Cog and add a breakdown key this 
[40:36](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2436) breakdown key is going to be very simple let's go 43 right in the middle and all we're going to do is pull it down that's the simplest breakdown key even that much I'm going to pull it down a little 
[40:46](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2446) more and here's what I'm talking about by delaying some of the movement of the spacing we're adding a little more movement to the back side so I just pulled it down to create the arc so 
[40:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2455) instead of going in a straight line from one idea to another one post to another the breakdown key I pulled it down it creates an arc and doing it on the Cog ensures that everything on the body gets 
[41:06](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2466) a little Arc so I just pulled it down I'm also going to pull it forward a little by pulling it forward I'm making the beginning a little slower and the end a 
[41:16](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2476) little faster I'm also going to add a little rotation down that's it oops insert a key and that's it that's the breakdown for 
[41:26](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2486) the body and what happens when you have a maybe a heavier character or more complex action you can even start to think about that the breakdown key needs to actually take 
[41:37](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2497) place a little bit over this foot not much because we're pushing off that foot and then and then it comes over the other foot 
[41:49](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2509) but here being from a profile no one sees it so I'm not too worried about how the weight is distributed but know that you can also treat it that way I'm not going to add too much movement really to 
[42:01](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2521) the rest of the body I'm going to add a little bit of delay on the hands so when the wrist comes up it's just a little more movement there might add a little bit of the fingers opening and the head 
[42:11](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2531) um just a little breakdown up in this case too he's looking this way maybe I I even inverse the breakdown maybe the chin gets delayed and it just comes down the other way I'll do a little bit on 
[42:21](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2541) the shoulder see what's the shoulder doing just coming forward you're just not going to see much it's not there's not much point to to do too 
[42:33](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2553) much um and over complicate some of these things the simpler usually the better 
[42:43](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2563) put a little bit of breakdown you can see I'm adding more in hand there insert a key and then I'm going to come to my wrist here go one frame over so by getting closer 
[42:56](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2576) to the end of the action I'm adding more movement to that part of the body like that so the fingers were in a fist here and 
[43:09](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2589) now they're open all I'm going to do is add a little bit of delay they were opening they're opening the whole time just going to keep it closed a bit more so then 
[43:18](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2598) the fingers have more movement on them and most likely this index finger is going to have more of that movement this rig I found for some reason um and maybe just the way I'm working 
[43:34](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2614) um normally I'll select all the fingers and rotate them at the same time but doesn't seem like that's working for this rig so I'm not sure 
[43:44](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2624) so it's a little slower doing them one by one one of the things I found because I've been animating now for professionally for 17 years um 
[43:56](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2636) yeah 16 17 years and a good 10 11 years I spent as an animator the last five six years moved into layout and one of the nice things about moving 
[44:09](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2649) into a different department and focusing on different aspects of filmmaking is I don't spend as much time posing anymore I get to the idea quicker because as I stepped away from animation 
[44:23](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2663) and focused more on cameras and filmmaking I realized how unnecessary some of the things we do in animation are we can spend hours posing for something that's not really 
[44:36](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2676) important so it's important if you are an animator to understand that it doesn't matter how beautiful you make things look if the viewer doesn't even see it 
[44:46](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2686) so don't so don't go spending uh don't don't overdo it with detail that's just not going to be seen I remember when I was first starting out 
[44:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2698) maybe my first year I literally spent four hours on one pose and just thinking about is the pinky better he or here and 
[45:07](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2707) you know just a lot of time wasted so um yes you don't need not everything is important let's put it that way let's go to the 
[45:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2719) Head now and we'll do the the breakdown there as well so I'm gonna do the reverse just to lay the chin up a little and it's going to come down 
[45:28](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2728) okay so now we can scrub nice and simple and and what I can do after is once I do I've done the breakdown which defines 
[45:41](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2741) the arc I'm going to do the settle now and it's just gonna it's basically gonna add an ease into that pose that we're going into and then I'll then focus on the feet again that step maybe that step 
[45:53](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2753) needs to come up a little and hit harder so that's a secondary thing is I'm just scrubbing near the end and I'm deciding where I want to insert a key I'm going to select all 
[46:05](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2765) and you can see what we have going on here this is our first pose frame 39 second pose and these two keys which are have a couple things maybe like six seven things keyed on the body minus the 
[46:18](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2778) different fingers this is our breakdown and now I'm scrubbing over and I'll probably insert a key on frame 45. so everything's selected all the 
[46:29](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2789) controls I'm just going to hit I I'm going to grab this keyframe G and move it over for now maybe just to frame 51. so here's what we have in the graph editor it's just being pulled 
[46:43](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2803) and if I scrub it basically just adds a little cushion to that move and that's important it helps the viewer just see the movement a little better what I like to do in blender here is I 
[46:56](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2816) have this keyframe selected I'm going to hit Ctrl D select the key itself and the handle on the right leaving me just the handle on the left G and X I can pull that handle 
[47:07](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2827) and you want to you want to pull it so that that settle is even stronger it's not as floaty what we can do is I'm going to just delete this keyframe here 53 
[47:18](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2838) and just bring this over 53 so it's just a long settle okay let's just keep going with the action but you can see how we're building it pose pose and we're defining 
[47:29](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2849) all the action and now we're adding some breakdown keys and saddles going block by block now so I just cleaned up a little bit of the footwork in those middle keys there and now let's 
[47:43](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2863) work on the last bit where he gets into zantic that squash pose and then that jump so I'm going to select everything and just work my way to that section A in the graph editor period numpad just 
[47:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2875) to see everything and here's that hold you can see it over here in the timeline so I'm just going to move everything over we're coming into that pose nice 
[48:04](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2884) and on an action like this typically that last frame I'll also start to craft as I as I get there and that way I'm just adding a little bit of drag as we get into that 
[48:15](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2895) pose not too much cool just adding a little bit of drag and then this foot the one that's going to land last 
[48:31](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2911) can just be a little more noticeable not much cool Ada selector insert a key and then here's that frame so we're ready to start adding a settle 
[48:41](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2921) but before we do I also want to pose that gets us into the squash or that gets us kind of out of the squash into the into the jump so that's what this area is for I'm 
[48:54](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2934) going to start working on the breakdown here favoring this key here so it's only four frames between these two poses so I'm going to start working on the 
[49:04](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2944) breakdown but favoring this key and so the breakdown instead of going in a straight line from here to where it is somewhere in this area 
[49:14](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2954) the breakdown is going to hold longer down so we'll start with the Cog and all I'm going to do is pull that Cog down it's still going to stay down longer and so now the arc instead of going 0.8 
[49:25](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2965) point B it arcs down a little bit and then when we jump we're able to jump higher and with any action I find it simplest when I work on the feet first this foot needs to be on the ground for 
[49:37](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2977) this long and you can just kind of get a sense of the timing that way just by keeping the feet on or off the ground and then it's easier to understand which way the Cog needs to go 
[49:48](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2988) so this foot needs to stay on the ground longer all I'm going to do is copy that pose control C and Ctrl V now I can have control over it staying on the 
[49:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=2998) ground and I'm just going to pull it over one more frame you can see how easy that is and even over here maybe 
[50:06](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3006) and and on that frame 76 I'll craft a pose just for that one frame so two frames of a hold and maybe even this back leg can be held one frame so I can select the two 
[50:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3019) controls that deal with the foot Ctrl C control V and already that's going to help that feels much better already cool so here's where we're at right now 
[50:33](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3033) with the first shot again I'm going to add a little um track screen right to the camera in the second shot and then we'll do the third shot 
[50:44](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3044) together as well I'll go a little quicker on that one so this demo isn't too long make sure everything is keyed on the camera insert a key perfect 
[50:55](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3055) and I'm also gonna insert a key on our focal length frame 83 and now we can frame for the new camera so over the cut I'm going to cheat sheet 
[51:11](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3071) the character up a little bit so he's going to be in this negative space coming in an arc a little bit still and then come land here low to the ground so this framing I have 
[51:21](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3081) an idea that this is generally the the framing that I want but I don't have the specific yet until I get the character Landing rolling and into that nice hero pose 
[51:33](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3093) here so I'm just going to keep the camera here for now and then affect the camera as the action gets closer just pull that up it looks much better in that screen space here I'm going to 
[51:46](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3106) use this empty screen space as well um he's going to come something like this something forward roll in this in this area and then land 
[51:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3118) in a cool hero pose right in right in front of the camera that'll look good so now that I'm in this new shot I'm going to update the characters pose from this new angle just 
[52:09](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3129) resetting my control just so I know what's going on now that stretch that I had the character stretched in the last shot is no longer important so I'm just resetting all those values all right so 
[52:22](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3142) I've cleaned up the pose here and let's start moving through space I'm going to be nice and brutal about it and I might even have it be 12 frames for my Landing I'm selecting the Cog and the foot 
[52:34](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3154) control just bring them forward and so this pose now has to be angled down because he's coming up and then he comes back down so all I'm going to do is just rotate that 
[52:47](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3167) body down and then drag the feedback up just like that so the character is getting ready for the landing so those arms and shoulders are going to stretch 
[52:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3178) forward as much as they can and I am gonna work on the landing pose itself the contact pose and I'm gonna have the character roll over um his left shoulder 
[53:10](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3190) so not just a front roll but more of a side roll and that means I'm going to have the contact for the left hand be a little more forward 
[53:24](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3204) awesome so here's the idea of this contact pose with a hand insert a key and now let's come in over here select these two keys and we're going to save vector 
[53:36](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3216) so we just come in like that I'm going to shorten this up a little we're just going to play it gonna get a sense of if the timing is correct if it feels good 
[53:50](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3230) cool and I think it is I'm going to give it a little bit more time because it is a cool idea just two more frames there we go so frame 83 somewhere around 89 is where he 
[54:05](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3245) 89.70 or pardon me 87.89 is where we're going to reach the peak of of height and then we're going to start to come down so I'm going to select the foot and the Cog 
[54:19](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3259) and we're just going to pull this character back up that's the breakdown defining that Arc cool so you can see how the character is still coming up 
[54:33](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3273) which is going to help with the with the second shot cut that in nicely and and then he comes down here what I'm going to do is every four frames back to that every four frames even sometimes every 
[54:45](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3285) two frames I'm just going to roll that character very rough into that action into the roll action so we can get into that cool hero moment and that's that's 
[54:56](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3296) what I'm after so I'm going to select everything go for four frames over 99 insert a key so that mass is still moving forward so all I'm going to do is pull that forward 
[55:08](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3308) and down cool something like that and already his his head is tucking so we're just going to be very very rough 
[55:20](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3320) here tuck that head and I'm going to reset the value already it wants to reset and when you tuck your head really it goes your chin goes right into your chest 
[55:32](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3332) and we're going over this shoulder over his left shoulder you can see how mangled the post starts to get because 
[55:43](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3343) you're getting into a difficult shape but that's okay but I'm gonna pull them forward and so already his head is being protected 
[55:53](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3353) so what the hands do in a row like this is protect the head help take that weight and really all you're looking for in one of these big actions is is just to get out of that 
[56:06](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3366) momentum and and uh and protect the body so the head roll the head tuck is part of it and the hands going over the shoulder is going to be the other part of it he's almost he's going to be on 
[56:18](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3378) his back now so you can see I'm going to just roll them over like this somewhere over there I'm not gonna even worry about the hands now it's more about the legs 
[56:32](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3392) coming over kind of just tucking like a little ball when you get into funky shapes like this yeah just pose it out very rough just like that we spent a good 20 
[56:48](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3408) seconds there I'm not even gonna worry about the hands just to see if the idea is working bring them forward again as he's getting out of the Roll 
[56:59](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3419) always that momentum is moving him forward and now he's gonna this this one leg is gonna tuck under him but we're just gonna pull that CLG see 
[57:12](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3432) how he's just rolling over and that's cool and and where are you like and then this one leg is going to be on 
[57:23](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3443) the ground he's going to use this one leg his right leg to help himself up just kind of tucks under him 
[57:35](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3455) really kind of funky let's we set some of these controls so let's just play what we have for now so you can see even with the terrible posing 
[57:48](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3468) it doesn't really matter when it comes to really fast action because I as if you're buyed and then it's going to be that last pose that we're going to spend a good four or five minutes making it 
[57:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3478) look good and he's going to take the weight so we're gonna have a um an overshoot pose and then he takes the weight maybe a look back I'm not sure 
[58:08](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3488) and then he'll just exit so now it's just about making this pose look cool I'm going to reset some of the values on these controls make sure it's not giving me anything funky one of the nice things 
[58:20](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3500) too that's forgiving on such a big action like I just did the roll is even if you have weird gimbal lock you can hide it over such a fast action and then you can reset the pose 
[58:34](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3514) essentially through the action the right way to work with this last pose so I'm going to clean this pose up I know that let's update our framing now 
[58:46](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3526) normally I'll do it through this window but here I'll just pull this camera Tab out to get out of my post mode and I'm just going to go in select the camera and affect my 
[58:56](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3536) framing here from this window so I might even have a longer fov if I'm gonna go in on his face more oh yeah that's gonna look good we're not even going to show the contact we'll 
[59:15](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3555) show the contact of him rolling on the ground but we'll end it in this nice mid shot and we'll see that Gap there as well 
[59:29](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3569) I think that's looking really cool I'm going to add a little bit of a camera move and the camera move is gonna finish just after he finishes his action currently 
[59:40](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3580) right now the pose ends on 107. but I know I'm going to have a little saddle and an overshoot so my camera move is going to end more around 
[59:52](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3592) 109 110 and then with a saddle 120. something like that I can already tell the camera move is going to need more time for the saddle but we'll do that after 
[01:00:04](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3604) so here's that pose I've spent a good couple minutes three four minutes uh refining the pose with the techniques you've seen in the past where I duplicate the pose improve the pose and 
[01:00:17](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3617) also copy the pose and add um a spline between them and let the computer also push the pose exaggerated a little bit and now what I like to do is actually 
[01:00:27](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3627) pose my it depends on the action in this case it's a more aggressive action and so that overshoot and the overshoot what that is is when there is a big 
[01:00:40](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3640) action you don't just come to a stop you come to a stop but you your momentum takes you a little further than you normally would and then you come back to 
[01:00:50](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3650) your your final pose so that overshoot is that pose that it that goes past um where you think you'd stop so you're taking that weight and then you come back so I'm going to key the overshoot 
[01:01:04](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3664) as opposed so I'm going to select all insert a key and I'm going to treat frame 107 as my overshoot and go four frames to frame 11 and that's going to be my final resting pose and in between 
[01:01:17](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3677) here I'm also still going to have a settle so I'm going to go to frame 107 and now I know the pose I'm getting into all I have to do is push the pose past this point so that's my overshoot and 
[01:01:29](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3689) then I come back just like most of these poses we're going to start with the Cog and all we're going to do is pull it forward his momentum after the roll is still 
[01:01:39](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3699) going this way and he has to catch himself uses muscles and then push himself back so you can see all I'm doing is pushing them forward a little rotate in rotating him down so we're 
[01:01:51](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3711) coming out of this roll into this pose and then and then back into that saddle so that's my overshoot pose and then that's the pose that I worked on it's easier to work on this 
[01:02:02](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3722) pose and then do the overshoot because this is our final resting pose I'm going to leave it there for this demo and I'm going to work a bit more on the secondary animation things like the 
[01:02:13](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3733) ears the paper in the back and the scarf in his tail clean that up and and polish it a bit I'm also going to try to sell the idea that there's wind blowing and he's on 
[01:02:25](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3745) top of this mountain and so just that feeling I think will be cool so I'm going to give that a try I'll give it a quick render and and then I'll come back with the 
[01:02:35](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3755) final result [Music] all right so here's the final result I added some secondary animation to the character the tail the ears and the 
[01:02:49](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3769) paper I also added the flag in the scene from sketchfab to help sell the idea of the Wind I hope you liked the video and got some 
[01:02:58](https://youtu.be/qTe80olHYSg?si=GlbC2cfSdqK4Fy2z&t=3778) value from it if you did please like it so that I know this content is useful okay thanks everybody bye [Music] foreign

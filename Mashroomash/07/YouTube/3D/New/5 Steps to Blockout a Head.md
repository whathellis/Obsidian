(Description:: In this video, I'll be breaking down my process for blocking out heads in ZBrush. There are five major parts to this process, however, you can speed this up by combining sections. I recommend that if you are struggling, to break things down into simpler and simpler shapes until it makes sense.)

# Transcript
[00:00](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=0) so uh the first thing I want to do is a little demo on blocking out some character heads it's uh something that I've not done in quite a while and I get a lot of questions about and uh who 
[00:14](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=14) doesn't want to sculpt heads faces you know it's like the most popular and fun thing to do uh so I'll show you guys some examples of what I'm thinking about first what I like to do and um I'll talk 
[00:28](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=28) about some of the differences between what I'm going to show you and what I actually do in practice because when I'm actually sculpting I uh I kind of like automate a lot of this stuff I do it a 
[00:36](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=36) lot faster than you would probably uh than what I'm probably gonna describe here I'm gonna like break it down into steps so we'll like kind of go over that together uh for those that are 
[00:47](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=47) unfamiliar or maybe new around here I have a little known tool that I created about a year ago called mod mesh mod mesh is an awesome tool that gives you a bunch of different pieces that you can 
[01:01](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=61) combine and I'm just going to pick some here at random oh I had a cool one there where'd it go I'll just do this one all right so mod mesh is a tool where you can combine all these different parts to 
[01:12](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=72) create some different heads and let's kind of scroll through here find a random one I kind of like the small one the gravy it's small but 
[01:23](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=83) it works all right I'll take a neck out for this guy and I want to show you this first we'll do that one anyway that's gravy again let's uh let's do a different one let's 
[01:34](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=94) do this long one the priest and neck let's pick out some ears oh you know what I kind of like that first one let's do that and then finally a quick nose 
[01:44](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=104) here uh these I might have to move around a little like that one let's see that the Macho I'll just 
[01:53](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=113) slide that out ever so slightly boom done cool so like I said this is my tool it's called mod mesh I released this like a year ago and uh you can use it to quickly mock up 
[02:06](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=126) a ton of different heads it's been a while since I've demoed it so one I wanted to show it off here at the start of the stream and two this is how we are going to kind of mentally break down 
[02:20](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=140) this process of how I like to or what I like to think about when I'm blocking out heads because if you guys have watched a lot of my videos you know that I'm not sitting here sub tooling out 
[02:33](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=153) splitting apart every single piece just because that takes a lot longer you get a lot more control but it's slower and I'm typically working a lot faster and kind of like I said kind of automating a 
[02:45](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=165) lot of this stuff this uh this tool you can get on my gum Road or modmesh.xyz is the URL if you're interested interested in it and want to check it out but what I'm going to do now is show you how we 
[03:00](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=180) can create like a custom one of these from scratch or how I would go about that so what I need from you guys in chat is a suggestion of a character that we can sculpt we're gonna stick with 
[03:14](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=194) Miles Morales I think that's a great suggestion we're gonna break this down into five steps we're gonna start with the two main shapes of the face then we're going to do neck ears and nose 
[03:25](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=205) this is called a blockout the purpose of a blockout is to capture the main forms of whatever you're sculpting character head body tree Rock plant creature whatever this guy's limit blockout means 
[03:44](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=224) primary forms essentially and that's what we're gonna do here so I still start to pretty much all my characters the same way here and that's with a sphere 
[03:53](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=233) and I do that just because it's like the basic shape roughly the basic shape of a skull and uh let's get into it so I'm going to start off 
[04:05](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=245) with one sphere trim the sides of the sphere this is essentially an alternate perspective here while I do this for a moment this is essentially the shape of the skull 
[04:16](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=256) roughly you know it's a sphere with some flat planes on the side and you can kind of see that happening here with this character with Miles then what we're going to do is we're going to take that 
[04:25](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=265) bottom sphere just gonna slide it down and we're gonna start shaping this into the the form of his jaw so if you guys have seen me do this on my channel I'll typically do 
[04:40](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=280) this with one shape I'm doing it with two here we're gonna do like five separate pieces and split things up but you know I'll explain some of the differences as I go 
[04:50](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=290) so for the jaw I like to think of the head as two separate parts there's the top part of the head which is the skull the sphere and then there's the bottom slash front portion which is the face so 
[05:03](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=303) you can kind of chop these up into a sphere and a wedge so that's kind of what I've done here I'm just going to use really basic tools here to like trim out shapes and I'm doing that really 
[05:15](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=315) quickly with the transpose line set to move you can just tap and trim stuff out like that there's a lot of different ways you can do that that's just a quick way I'm gonna be using simple tools like 
[05:25](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=325) the move brush here as we continue forward I'm just going to start pushing things around so the first thing I like to capture here after I start creating this piece 
[05:34](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=334) is the jawline and I'll just do that with a pinch brush one of my custom brushes you don't need custom brushes to do this you can do this with all the basic stuff but if you are interested in 
[05:44](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=344) grabbing my brushes there should be a link below to my gum Road where you can grab those so there is our basic jaw so if we look over here at Miles let's 
[05:58](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=358) take a look at a couple different shapes right so we have this area right here this is where the eyes are going to live it is this separative section between the top and 
[06:11](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=371) bottom section of the head so what does that mean that means that this is going to be this area here is going to be our eye cavity so what we're going to do 
[06:22](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=382) is I'm just gonna start pinching this top area this is his upper brow here and I'm looking at his upper Brown I'm just getting like a a basic idea of that really really simple and 
[06:34](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=394) then I'm looking at this shape and I'm just following it around and it looks like it goes all the way down here roughly to his nose and if I look over here at the three quarter it's even 
[06:41](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=401) easier to see it just wraps around his brow wraps around the side wraps down all the way around there so it's like this big round cavity shape like this that's kind of what we're looking at so 
[06:55](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=415) really simple basic shape okay now let's start looking at that a little more closely you know it comes out and around here and then it kind of goes down right take a look at this you 
[07:09](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=429) can like see this shape right here so this is telling us that this here is the side of his face and this little highlight that's kind of where it's starting to change direction so let's 
[07:22](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=442) put another line right there just another quick little pinch you know just one you know if I can turn off my sim I knew that's gonna happen a little duplication so we got one and two front 
[07:41](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=461) side of the plane front front portion of the face side portion of the face okay so that's what we're looking for at this time front and side so let's start breaking this down more 
[07:53](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=473) again accuracy not our goal we're just kind of breaking down this process it Narrows as it comes down so we're narrowing into the chin just like that so let's make it more narrow 
[08:05](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=485) so it goes from wide to narrow and all we have to do is observe this in our reference we just have to take the time to look closely make an observation attempt to make that form and then 
[08:22](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=502) observe again and repeat that's kind of what we're looking at so like I said I'm going to break this down pretty slow here we'll just continue going 
[08:30](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=510) [Music] take a look at that top piece and maybe make it a little wider I might have made it a little too narrow I'm actually noticing that it goes this way a little 
[08:40](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=520) you know it comes out so I can change that angle slightly I can play with that never be afraid to go back and keep making changes something roughly 
[08:54](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=534) roughly like that all right so now we're going to add on another piece we're going to add on the neck and for that I'm just going to use the cylinder so I'll click on a pen and 
[09:03](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=543) grab myself a quick cylinder slide that down do a quick scale make it a little longer and slide it up into the head 
[09:18](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=558) so let's just observe again I can see over here where the neck is it's got a pretty narrow neck you know Maybe 
[09:29](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=569) maybe around there and I'll angle that back a little the neck isn't like perfectly straight typically feels pretty awkward if you do something like that 
[09:40](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=580) so now we can just play with the proportions a little here I'm not too worried about having it perfect but I'll spend you know a minute here 
[09:50](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=590) just tweaking choosing my move brush also if you're working you know you're sculpting in zbrush or blender or whatever you can always just use some kind of 
[10:01](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=601) Auto Tool to re-mesh your geometry we have dynamesh and zbrush and that just gets rid of all your pinches it gives it a quick redistribution of polys you can get something cleaner if you want with 
[10:12](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=612) zero measure it doesn't really matter I'm not someone that cares a ton about tools tools are just like an end way to get to your goal [Music] 
[10:22](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=622) um but you know obviously you have to be knowledgeable in the software I've been using zbrush for a very long time and uh I tend to think less about tools and try to think more about form and it's kind 
[10:37](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=637) of where you want to be in terms of sculpting all right I'm just playing around here a couple more changes making it narrower up top 
[10:47](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=647) here toward the front notice I got like this really you know sharp edge right here it's not super accurate so I'll just go over that trim it out and we'll come you know we'll be jumping 
[11:01](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=661) around a lot we'll be playing with some different things let's take a look at that three-quarter angle this is probably sticking out a little 
[11:09](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=669) too far in the bottom and probably not sticking out far enough for the top let's play with that my lights being a little funky too might 
[11:19](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=679) have to adjust that all right cool let's add on some ears ears are super easy so we'll just append another sphere 
[11:32](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=692) and I won't start with symmetry here I'm just gonna start with one sphere and then I'll duplicate it after the fact [Music] yes the the spider-verse was incredible 
[11:46](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=706) I agree uh yeah the pinch Rush is a custom one yeah you can grab it from my brushes over on my gum Road quadri measure use use whatever you can 
[11:59](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=719) for for rematching I I tend to care less about the technical stuff because as technology evolves uh you can worry more and more about the 
[12:11](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=731) artistic side of things and less about the technical you can always learn the technical stuff but the and those are always going to change as well but like with the artistic stuff the fundamentals 
[12:20](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=740) will always be the same which is what's really good about learning that kind of stuff all right ear got distracted you guys are distracting me talking about this great 
[12:30](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=750) movie uh all right so let's take a look at the ear it needs to maybe be like a little higher right the ear is roughly in line with the eye depending on the Tilt and angle of the 
[12:43](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=763) head that can be confusing and depending on the person it's always going to be different right no two people are the same unless you're twins 
[12:52](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=772) in that case I guess you are like identical basic shape of the ear something like that okay once we have that in place all we 
[13:04](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=784) have to do is mirror it to the other other side here and weld awesome all right you'll notice like the the big 
[13:15](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=795) awkward no man's land Excuse Me Gap here this T is killing me uh this is really easy to fix after we blend the parts together so if you have these awkward kind of Gap areas don't 
[13:28](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=808) worry about it too much don't spend like a ton of time cleaning that that kind of stuff up all right so there's the ears and all that's left is the nose he's got a pretty cool nose nice and wide at the 
[13:39](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=819) bottom skinny at the top we love taper when we're talking about appeal so let's append another sphere our good friend the sphere he's gonna be helping us out a 
[13:49](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=829) lot here so let's scale down and uh I have done is that not symmetrical no I think we're good look it threw me 
[14:02](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=842) off for a second uh so I have done I don't even remember what I was gonna say it doesn't matter it wasn't important face needs to go back in a little 
[14:12](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=852) there we go I have made a lot of noses and they're all the the basic process is pretty much the same I have a video on my Channel showing like a quick step-by-step guide 
[14:23](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=863) what I'm going to do here is going to be a super simplified version so let's see put this middle sphere 
[14:35](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=875) for the ball of the nose the tip of the nose that might be a little too big I don't really care actually like I said the proportions aren't that important and 
[14:46](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=886) then I'm just going to duplicate and do like two of these kind of like this and then I'll just mirror that to the other side and then just repurpose this geometry 
[15:00](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=900) pull it up in the middle something like that so it gets narrow toward the middle wide at the bottom and then wide again see how stretched 
[15:15](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=915) that's getting just dynamesh it boom you're fixed alright so that's a basic process four nose need some more tweaking to get our 
[15:24](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=924) proportions right but I think you guys get the basic process all right we'll scale down the wings or a la of the nose 
[15:38](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=938) and that feels pretty good and I'll finish this up it's like one or two more tweaks and we can combine these different parts as well 
[15:54](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=954) it doesn't have to be super detailed I'll just merge it all remesh so the point here with a block out is not to work on details you just want to focus on these big shapes 
[16:05](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=965) just capture the big shapes it's it's not really that everything comes easier from spheres it's just I mean you can start with a cube you could start with a a prism it doesn't 
[16:18](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=978) matter essentially what you're doing here is it's less about the focus on the sphere and more about the focus on super basic primary forms so that's kind of our 
[16:32](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=992) our area of focus here let's make this look like way bigger am I am I wrong or is this shape like way bigger 
[16:41](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1001) and I don't want to get stuck here playing with details on this right I was just talking about how that is not the objective something like that so these are the 
[16:54](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1014) five parts that you need I got a little messy there these are the five parts you need to block out ahead it is really this simple you know this is 
[17:06](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1026) some really basic shapes for miles I could sit here and like start to line things up a lot more and you know I I started this by saying it's 
[17:19](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1039) not you know we're not trying to focus on proportions but if we wanted to if I was a stickler for that kind of thing 
[17:31](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1051) which I might be if you've seen my sculpts before then we could sit here and Fiddle with it you know get it to a really nice clean spot 
[17:42](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1062) I think you guys get the general idea there on what we're going for all right let me remesh clean those up and then I'll show you what you can do in terms of like next steps from here 
[17:57](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1077) awesome okay so one two three four five easy peasy mild squeezy merge visible I'm just going to merge this into one piece so if you are 
[18:11](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1091) working on a character and you get to this stage and you're like all right so I watched that polygon video I blocked out my my Miles Morales character head now what do I do like how do I continue 
[18:23](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1103) forward with this well what you do is you take your five pieces you combine them all like I just did there you can either merge them dynamash them whatever I like to use dynamesh so I'll just grab 
[18:33](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1113) them all and do like a 200 or so which is probably fine for this resolution and I'll dynamesh them all just like this 
[18:41](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1121) and start smoothing them all together and careful not to like over smooth over blend anything like that especially in this area I told you guys earlier I pointed this out this area 
[18:56](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1136) we're just going to go back over top and start to fill that in there's some like other Anatomy here right everybody's favorite neck muscle the sternocleidomastoid 
[19:05](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1145) um as well as some you know fat Under the Skin other stuff connecting here like your uh wow your tricep triceps trapezius dear 
[19:21](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1161) Lord triceps your trapezius you got a bunch of next stuff going on here in the front so that would be like next steps in 
[19:30](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1170) terms of moving forward your freaking neck triceps gee man oh boy I need to grab a coffee um so there you go that's that's kind of the basic process from going from uh you 
[19:45](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1185) know individual pieces starting to block out those main shapes and then going in and starting to combine and keep pushing forward obviously things are really rough at this stage you've got all these 
[19:56](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1196) sharp edges so you got to go through you got to start making things feel more organic if you have any like baked in expression you got to get rid of that we gotta start you know sculpting some eyes 
[20:07](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1207) on this character which you know we could take some time to do but I don't want to you know spend the rest of our time here starting to or continuing to push forward on that because it's going 
[20:19](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1219) to take a really long time uh so there's the basic process hopefully you guys enjoyed it and uh I will now open the discussion for questions and uh if we don't have any we'll move on to another 
[20:31](https://youtu.be/sIE9ifC6cyU?si=94qJCqGd3ER159Oj&t=1231) demo which will be fun too

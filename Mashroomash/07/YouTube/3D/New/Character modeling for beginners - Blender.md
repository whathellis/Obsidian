[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=0) so you want to make a character well there are a few ways to go about it I prefer box modeling that's what I'm doing in this video and it's basically just starting with simple shapes pushing 
[00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=9) points around and slowly adding detail as you need it another common workflow is sculpting and then retopologizing with sculpting the upside is that you can make whatever shapes you want 
[00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=20) without worrying about topology but then you end up with a really dense mesh and that makes it not very good for rigging and animating so you have to fix the topology if you want to do those things 
[00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=30) there's also something to be said about style like if you want to make a more realistic model then the arms and the legs will probably be connected to the Torso and you have to put a little more 
[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=39) effort into making things attach properly but if you're all right with how it looks there's nothing stopping you from keeping all of the limbs as separate objects which is what I usually 
[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=48) do and it's what we'll do to make this character because it's a little more beginner friendly but before we do that I want to show you how quickly you can make a low poly human model I personally 
[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=59) don't really like like making realistic humans and I think if you plan on doing that you should just find a free human model to use as a base mesh and then sculpt on top of it and do some 
[01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=68) retopology there are plenty of free models and retopology tools just for realistic humans and Nagi over here actually does this in a few videos but for the sake of knowledge let's make a 
[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=79) low poly human and then you can make the lethal company squl or something like that so let's open up blender and this is version 4.1 but all of this should work even if you're using version 3.0 so 
[01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=91) don't worry too much about that also this is a beginner tutorial but if you don't know how to move around blender or if you want to learn a little more a little or if you want to learn a little 
[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=101) about modeling first then check out these two videos of mine to get up to speed and just know that you might have to pause occasionally to follow this video so if you want a reference picture 
[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=111) you can drag it directly into blender when you're in object mode and you can change the opacity over here but I'm not using one in this video so I'm just going to delete it with X okay first 
[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=122) thing we need is a cube so if you don't already have one in your scene you can press shift a and add in a cube right here and if you're wondering why my colors look like this and you want yours 
[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=132) to look like this you can just go up to the top right up here click this arrow set it to mat cap and choose this one or one of the other ones from the list and I also always have cavity turned on and 
[02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=144) set to both and this just accentuates the edges and makes it a little easier to see so this cube is going to be used for the Torso I'm just going to press one to look from the front right here 
[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=154) and tab into edit mode and this should already be selected but you can also press a to select everything G and Z to bring it up just a little bit right there and S to scale it down now you 
[02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=166) might be able to see these squares right here each one of these squares is 1 M and people are typically under 2 m tall so I usually use uh two of these squares as like a reference for human height so 
[02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=179) I'm just going toy try to keep everything under 2 m press s to scale and right now I'm looking for the width of this I'm going to make it as wide as I think the Torso should be so maybe 
[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=188) right about here s and Z to scale it up gz bring it up now let's look from the side and I want to make this a little skinnier so s and Y to scale it on the Y AIS right there now I'm going to add a 
[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=203) neck you can either press three to go into face select mode or click this button up here select the top face I to inset just a little bit and I want this to be a little more Square so I'll press 
[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=214) s and x and we can scale it on the x axis G and Z to bring it up just a little bit e to extrude to bring this up e to extrude again s to scale this is going to be for the head e to extrude e 
[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=229) to extrude and S to scale that down so now we have a torso and a head and I want a spot for the arm to come out so let's press controlr to add in a loop cut and we'll bring this up to right 
[04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=242) about here I'm looking for something that's kind of close to a square shape right here now again press three to go into face select mode or click this button up here select that face right 
[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=251) there e to extrude just a little bit we can press s to scale that down this is going to be for the shoulder area now e to extrude we're going to extrude out to where we think maybe the wrist should be 
[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=262) scale that down now if you want to make this more rectangular you can I'll press s and Z we can scale it down right about there this is going to be for the wrist now we can e to extrude for the hand 
[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=273) contrl R for another loop cut this is going to be for the thumb we're not going to make all the fingers this is going to be kind of Mitten style press three to go into face select mode or 
[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=282) that button up there e to extrude out for the thumb and we can scale that down um I'm going to scale it on the z-axis to make it a little skinnier at the end now don't worry about the other side 
[04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=292) right now because we're just going to add a mirror modifier later so we're only going to do one side right now it's a good idea to add some loops for the elbow so I'll press crlr we can add one 
[05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=303) right in the middle with right click now I'll bevel this with crl b and use the scroll wheel to add another loop in the middle right here this will make it so the elbow deforms a little better when 
[05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=312) we bend the arm now we need a spot for the legs to come out so we're going to add a loop cut right down the middle right here with contrl r three to go into face select mode select that bottom 
[05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=322) face e to extrude and we can scale that down just a little bit now we'll look from the front with one and E2 extrude down to right about here where we think like the ankle is going to start we can 
[05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=334) s to scale and I also want to extrude down this is going to be for our foot now if you want it to snap to the zero point perfectly you can go up here to snapping settings leave it set to 
[05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=344) increment but we can turn on absolute grid snap now when you're moving this around with G you can hold control and it will snap to the grid so we can snap it to that perfect point right there and 
[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=355) you can even see over here that the Z is set to 0 m so we know it works right now I'll look from the side over here make sure you're in face select we can select this front face and E to extrude this is 
[06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=366) going to be for the foot you know maybe zoom out to make sure that it's the size you want go into Edge select mode with that button or two and we can bring this top part down and if you want the foot 
[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=378) to be able to bend in the middle a little better you can also add a loop cut here press contrl B to Bevel it and again you can use the scroll wheel to make sure that there's a loop in the 
[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=387) middle also to shape the foot a little little more let's press one to look from the front alt Z to go into x-ray mode or you can press this button up here one for vertex select and I'll just select 
[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=397) the whole bottom of the foot and press s and X to scale that out just a little bit right here and I'll select these two points right here and pull this out for the heel now we can add a loop for the 
[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=408) knee with contrl r and again contrl B to Bevel that and make sure that there's a loop in the middle another thing I like to do for the hip area is again press alt Z to go in into x-ray mode select 
[07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=421) these points right here and just bring them up slightly like that now we should probably mirror this to get the arm and the leg to the other side so I'm actually just going to select everything 
[07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=430) on this side right here again I'm in x-ray mode for this so I am actually selecting all the way through press X and delete all the vertices now we can come over here to the modifier panel it 
[07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=441) looks like a little wrench click the add modifier button and you can either type in Mirror just start typing mirror or under generate you can add the mirror modifier right there now if this isn't 
[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=452) working right for you it might mean that your origin point is not actually in the center so just select your model right here press crol a and apply the location and that should make this work now we 
[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=463) can also smooth this out with a subdivision surface modifier you can press contrl 1rl 2 or contrl 3 and that's just going to change the viewport level over here and now we can go into 
[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=473) edit mode again and start smoothing this out so it's a little less boxy you can see it's pretty flat in the front right there so what I like to do is select the whole Center Loop right here you can do 
[08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=483) that with alt and left click and I'll press seven to look from the top s and Y and we can scale this out just a little bit and you can see it's getting a little more round and if you want you 
[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=494) can do this separately for the head and for the body but I just did it for the whole thing I'll make the head a little bit wider also so again I'm in x-ray mode for this with alt Z I'll just 
[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=504) select these two points right here and we can bring it out so it's a little more round and if if you want to mess with any of the proportions you know make the legs a little longer anything 
[08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=513) like that you can make your character uh skinnier now is the time to do that it's also a good idea to press crlr and add one or two Loops in the body right here and that will make it deform a little 
[08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=525) bit better as well this is low poly but when you rig it up it will deform pretty well isn't that [Music] right if this is too low res for you you 
[09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=540) can add more detail by applying the subdivision surface modifier and then you'll have more verts to work with there are also ways of making the joints to form better and you can find some 
[09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=549) topology guides if you look around I like searching on Pinterest but this is definitely enough for a beginner video so let's put this stylized character together now the main difference with 
[09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=559) this one is that all of the limbs are separate pieces and I think this makes it much easier to get complex shapes because you don't really have to worry about connecting them you'll see what I 
[09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=568) mean but first let's talk about Playbook who was the sponsor for this video Playbook is a cloud storage website that is specifically made for creatives and collaboration and before I tell you 
[09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=578) anything else you can use my link to get 4 terabytes of storage for free yes for free no strings attached now that I have your attention I think Playbook is going to be a great fit for most of you 
[09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=590) watching first off it definitely excels at viewing and organizing images and videos I dropped all my renders in here and it kept the folder structure which is cool but you can also re order stuff 
[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=600) check it out in a different view or group files together you can also add tags to everything so if I want to see all my avatar renders I can give them a tag and then see them all at once even 
[10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=610) if they're in different folders you can also link other cloud storage sites like Google Drive and Dropbox to see all of your files in Playbook sharing files is really easy just turn on sharing and 
[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=620) anyone with the link can view and comment and even leave timestamps on videos which makes it really good for client work since they'll be able to comment about changes they'd like and if 
[10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=630) you want to give more control you can invite people as collaborators and then they can add things of their own you could also publish one of your boards and use it like a portfolio or as a way 
[10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=640) of sharing files with the public Playbook is still pretty new so they're always adding new features and you can see what's on the road map and suggest features yourself 4 tabt is a ton of 
[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=650) free storage and if you need more you can sign up for one of their other plans and just so you know these other paid plans is how they make money and what makes this free tier possible they 
[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=659) aren't in the business of selling data and if they were I wouldn't be advertising this right now so use my link in the description for 4 terabytes of storage and a brand new creative Hub 
[11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=668) on playbook for real check out Playbook when you support them you're also supporting me all right back to the video so for the next character let's start a new file just make sure you save 
[11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=677) first so for this one I do have some reference photos let's just make a new collection by hovering over here and pressing C so I have them right here I have three of them and you can get these 
[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=686) by following the link in the description I'm just going to press one to look from the front and then I'll drag it in I'll press three to look from the side drag in the side picture and seven to look 
[11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=698) from above and these are the numpad shortcuts you can also just use this uh widget in the corner from the top let's just drag in the top right here and we can select all of them press alt G and 
[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=709) that will snap them to the center now from the front I'm just going to bring this up G and z and we can scale it down again I'm just looking at these two squares so we can scale them down until 
[12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=720) it looks about the right height and they should all be the same size so you don't really have to resize them now with all of them selected you can press this button over here and we can turn on 
[12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=730) opacity but while you're checking this hold alt and that will toggle it for all of them at the same time now we can turn this down slightly and again I'm holding alt while I change this otherwise it's 
[12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=739) only going to change one now just so they don't get in the way of anything I'm going to push them around and now if we want to turn them on and off we have all of them in the their own collection 
[12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=750) up here and I'm just going to make it so none of them can be selected by pressing this button right here and if you don't have that you can turn it on with this button over here in the corner now let's 
[12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=758) make a new collection and this is just going to be for our cat which is named bzo you can name it whatever you want though and again we're just going to start with some cubes so shift a add in 
[12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=768) a cube right here I'm going to press control 2 to add a subdivision surface modifier as you can see over here now from the front bring it up scale it down this is going to be for the head we're 
[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=778) just going to get a lot of the shapes started shift d bring this down this is going to be for the body then I'll add in a plane with shift a and this is going to be for the arms and the legs 
[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=788) and I'm going to use the skin modifier for this you can actually make a whole base character with the skin modifier and you can see that in this video over here so let's go to the modifier panel 
[13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=797) press the add modifier button and I'm just going to search for Mirror you can just start typing so we have the mirror modifier I want the skin modifier enter and a subdivision surface so the skin 
[13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=809) modifier basically what it does is it gives thickness to edges as you can see here and then the subdivision is just smoothing it out so now we can tab into edit mode I'm going to look from the 
[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=819) front alt Z for x-ray mode and I actually want to merge everything into one point so M merge at Center like that make sure you're in vertex select mode select this point and press crl a and 
[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=831) that's how you scale it up and down or you can mess with these values over here so I'm going to scale this down until the thickness looks about right and we can just start moving this around again 
[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=840) I'm in edit mode for this this is going to be for the leg so I'll bring it up here e to extrude Z to bring it straight down like that it might be hard to tell in the recording but there is a circle 
[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=851) around this point right here and that means that this is the route which is important because if you have a line that doesn't have a root the skin modifier won't recognize it and it won't 
[14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=861) make it thick so make sure that you're duplicating the one with the circle around it so shift d and I'll bring that up right about here e and X and we can bring it out we're not going to make the 
[14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=871) hands right now we'll make those in a little bit and just to show you how to handle this if it doesn't have a root um let's just duplicate this one right here and to bring it to the center we can go 
[14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=880) up here and for the X Type in zero and we'll extrude that upward now this doesn't have any thickness so let's just select this point right here go over to the modifier panel and press Mark rot 
[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=891) and now it will get thicker let's tab back into object mode shift a and I'm going to add in a cube and this is going to be for the feet let's press tab to go into edit mode 
[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=901) GZ1 that's going to bring it up one meter tab back into object mode and that just makes it so that the origin is at the very bottom so when we scale it you can see it's uh instead of scaling from 
[15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=910) the center it's scaling from the bottom of the cube so for this I actually want a mirror modifier we can just press this type in mirror and if we move it to the side you can see it's not really 
[15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=920) mirroring again that's because it mirrors from the origin point so like I said before you can press CR a and apply the location and that will work but I like being able to scale it from here so 
[15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=931) instead of doing that let's go to this mirror object and the modifier panel I'm going to select the head basically you want it to be something that's in the middle because that's what's determining 
[15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=941) the center point for the mirror modifier so now we can move this to wherever we want over here let's turn the reference back on and just scale it to a point where you think it looks good or if it 
[15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=951) matches the reference now with everything in place let's press a contrl a and apply the scale this is important important uh for modifiers cuz a lot of modifiers look at the scale and this 
[16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=963) will change how they act so it's important to apply your scale right now nothing is named over here you can uh either select things over here double click and rename it so I'll name this 
[16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=973) head or you can do this in the viewport by selecting and pressing F2 I'll name this torso Limbs and feet and don't forget to save so just like the first model you can stop right here and use 
[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=985) this as a base for a bunch of different characters let's keep going though so so we can make this a little more polished we'll start with the head I'm just going to duplicate this with shift d and this 
[16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=994) is what we're going to use to make this mouth area that you can see in the reference S and Y to bring this out a little bit and we can just get this kind of close look from the front SX and we 
[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1007) can bring this across if we want we can scale this in slightly now again make sure that you're applying the scale of these so I'll select both of them crl a apply scale so when we select the head 
[16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1018) and tab into edit mode you can see that it's still a cube and I want to make the ears and the fur and stuff like that but if I start adding more Loop Cuts with controlr you can see it's changing the 
[17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1030) shape pretty dramatically so before going into edit mode Let's actually go over to the modifiers and we can actually apply this right here I like to apply it with as little detail as I need 
[17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1041) we can click this button press apply and then we can tab back into edit mode and we have all these squares to work with now let's select these two fa is right here I to inset I again for individual 
[17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1052) right here and I'll scale this down pretty small and now I want to bring this out for this I like to use alt s which is the shrink and fatten tool like that look from the front and get this 
[17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1063) pretty close and if we want we can smooth this out back in object mode with control 2 and we're going to use the mirror modifier for this one so let's tab back into edit mode alt Z I'm going 
[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1074) to press one to go into vertex select select half X delete those now back in object mode we can add a mirror modifier you can see the seam in the middle that's just because the mirror modifier 
[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1086) isn't first so we can just drag it to the top like that and it should clear that up now tab back into object mode for the ears I'm going to select these and extrude them but I want them to be 
[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1097) more circular so I'm going to press contrl Z to go back and we actually want to use an add-on for this but it's already built in so you don't have to worry about downloading anything just go 
[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1107) to edit preference is add-ons and you can search for Loop tools make sure this is enabled and then you can go to save preferences if you want that to always be on with these faces selected right 
[18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1119) click Loop tools is at the top and you can just select Circle and it will turn all of these into a circle so I'm just going to scale this up don't scale it up so much so that you know these points 
[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1129) overlap over here but I'm going to scale it up pretty big and E to extrude right about there I'm going to scale this down I want them to be kind of round at the edge you can look from the side and I'll 
[19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1140) bring this forward just a little bit if you want you can also make this even more round by going into x-ray mode press one for vertex select we can select these and just move them up like 
[19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1151) that I'm also going to select this and bring it forward now if you're having trouble seeing where the points are we have a few options uh over here on the subdivision surface modifier you can 
[19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1160) either turn this off in the viewport this works for object and edit mode this one right here turns it off only in edit mode and this one Mak makes it so that it kind of conforms to it so usually I 
[19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1172) just kind of turn it on and off and you'll see me do that quite a bit so now I want to make the inner ear so I'm going to select these two faces I to inset I again so it's not individual and 
[19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1183) we can scale that in quite a bit going to select these three points right here and drag them down bring them in like that let's select these faces again and just extrude that and if you want you 
[19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1196) can also scale it up slightly let's make these whiskers next so I'm just going to select this right here and you can see we're still working with a cube so I'm actually going to apply this also and 
[20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1207) I'll press control 2 in the viewport tab into edit mode select these three faces right here I to inset I again and if these aren't Square enough for you you can do a few things you can rightclick 
[20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1219) go to Loop tools and change this to a circle you only have four points to work with so it's just going to turn it into a square basically and if you want to scale it down further but they're all 
[20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1227) scaling at the same time like that you can press period and change the pivot point to individual Origins that's also this option up here and then it will scale the individual faces down now we 
[20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1239) can press e to extrude these out and you can see they're already being pushed in the normal Direction but if they aren't you can contrl Z to go back and you can use alt e instead and then you have 
[20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1249) these other options one of which is extrude faces along normals which should make that work and I want these to be sharp right here instead of smooth like that so going to press two to go into 
[20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1259) Edge select mode and we can select this edge with alt and left click and you can see when I have the subdivision surface turned on and I change this mean crease option all the way up it becomes sharp 
[21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1271) right there um the shortcut for that is shift e so let's select this one with alt and left click and press shift e instead you can see it does the same thing so we can do that for all of them 
[21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1281) let's mirror this also so in edit mode let's just go into x-ray mode and we can select this half and I'll delete the vertices you can go over here add the mirror modifier and make sure it's at 
[21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1293) the top for the nose we're going to use some modifiers for this too so shift a add in a plane press rx90 to rotate at 90¬∞ drag it up and I'm just going to start scaling it down and 
[21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1306) getting it into place and I want to add two modifiers one of which is the subdivision surface so for that we can do control 2 and the other one is to give it some thickness and that is the 
[21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1317) solidify modifier so I either under generate you can choose solidify or you can just start typing it in and to make this smoother we can just bring the solidify to the top and we can also play 
[22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1327) with the thickness amount and I usually like to set the offset to zero so that it's extruding from the center like that let's bring this a little closer to the face look from the front and we can 
[22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1337) start shaping this if it's too hard to see you can actually just select other objects and press h to hide them and then you can press alt H to bring them back so I'm just going to hide these two 
[22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1348) we can select the nose and keep modeling in edit mode so I'm just going to select these top two points and we can scale this out quite a bit scale this one down so in object mode I'll press alt H 
[22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1359) rotate it from the side to kind of make it conform to the Head now if you want a mouth that's a little more realistic and is actually built into the head you can use the method that I show in this video 
[22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1368) over here it'll show you some topology tricks to make it pretty easy but for this one we're going to go for a more 2D style mouth and it's basically using the same method that I used for the nose so 
[22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1379) we can just duplicate the nose right here press alt R to reset the rotation rx90 to rotate it 90¬∞ we can drag it down into the side tab into edit mode we can scale this down a little scale this 
[23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1393) one up to make it a little more rectangular select everything with a s to scale Z we'll make this a little thinner I'll add a loop cut in the middle scale this select these two side 
[23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1404) points bring it down a little and rotate I want it even thinner so I'll select all of these points on the bottom and press GG to Loop slide now back in object mode we can rotate this a little 
[23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1417) now this looks a little too thick so we can select it go to the modifier panel and turn down the thickness um if it's moving too fast you can hold shift and that makes it move a little slower like 
[23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1427) that and if you don't want to have to like rotate This and like Snap to the face manually you can turn on face snapping so to do that go up to the snapping menu up here you can turn on 
[23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1437) face turn on Center and you can turn on a line rotation to Target that's going to make it rotate based on the face that you're snapping it to um just make sure to turn it off if you want it to stop 
[24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1448) rotating so now when you press G and hold control it will snap like that let's go into x-ray mode and just line this up a little closer we can also rotate it a little like that if you want 
[24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1461) you can scale it down do whatever you want to make it look good to you if you do scale it at all just make sure that you're applying the scale afterward again for the eyes we're going to do 
[24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1470) kind of a two-dimensional method but if you want something that's more realistic you can watch this video over here I talk about how to make three different types of eyes and don't worry about 
[24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1479) rigging and animating this cuz I'm going to show that in the next video it's actually really easy to rig a 2d style eye like this so don't worry about that so let's just select the nose again 
[24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1489) shift d to duplicate and I'm actually going to bring this back to the origin first with alt G and ALT R we can tab into edit mode I'm going to delete this and I'm going to add a plane the reason 
[24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1499) I'm doing this is basically so that we can keep the modifiers that we already have but I am going to add a new one which is the mirror modifier just make sure that's at the very top and we don't 
[25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1509) want this to merge together unless you're looking for something a little more like a Sonic style eye so I'm going to turn off merging back in object mode I'm just going to uh set the mirror 
[25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1519) object to the Head now I still have face snapping turned on over here so I'll press G and hold control and you can see it's kind of snapping to the face we can just scale that down over here so that 
[25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1531) they're not like plates stuck to the head like this I'm actually going to use the shrink wrap modifier so again we can go to add modifier shrink wrap which I think is under deform it is right here 
[25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1543) but you can also just type it in now let's bring this again to the very top and we can Target the head that cuz that's what we want it to shrink wrap to so it looks like it disappeared but it's 
[25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1552) actually just inside of the head and that's because it's only actually snapping Four Points let's come into edit mode right click and we can subdivide once go to Loop tools and turn 
[26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1563) this into a circle back in object mode we can also press control a and apply the scale and that's just going to make it so that the solidify modifier is actually reading an accurate thickness 
[26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1573) right here we can make that thicker now we can basically just scale this to whatever we think looks good um I'll use the reference and this is actually pretty close already so to rotate it so 
[26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1583) that they're not all diagonal like this I'll press R ZZ and that's going to rotate it on the local axis and we can just get it a little flatter and back in edit mode if you want you can you know 
[26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1594) change the shape of these bring these down a little I'll select the middle and I'll bring that down now for the pupils we can do the same thing I'm actually just going to duplicate this and I'm 
[26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1605) going to turn off shrink wrapping and we can scale this down back in edit mode just select everything right click and turn this into a circle back in object mode we can press G and hold control to 
[26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1616) start snapping like this and and if you don't like how the origin point isn't actually in the very center you can reset it by right clicking set origin to center of mass surface like that using 
[27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1627) face snapping with rotating um makes this a lot easier because you don't actually have to adjust the rotation so I definitely recommend using that and don't forget to apply the scale when 
[27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1638) you're done with this because it's going to change what the solidify modifier actually looks like the eyebrows are using the same method so let's just duplicate the pupils right here we can 
[27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1649) drag this up I'm just going to hide a few of these with h press alt R rx90 so that it's flat it's a little easier to work with when it's flat in my opinion now in edit mode Let's select 
[27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1660) this Loop right here with alt left click and we can press contrl X that will actually dissolve it I believe if you just press X you also get dissolve options right here and I was in Edge 
[27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1670) mode for that so you want to make sure you're dissolving the edges now let's just bring this a little closer over here a little further out can scale this down scale this down also scale the 
[28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1681) center up and in object mode this is where we can rotate it to you know get it a little closer I am going to come in here select these two press a g and then x x and that will move it in the the 
[28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1693) local orientation cuz I know these are supposed to be a little longer probably back in object mode alt H so we can actually see everything and now we can start rotating this and I'll snap it to 
[28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1703) the pupils to match the rotation and we can just drag it up like that and and I also want to make this thicker the only thing left is the hair and for that shift a we can add in a cube in edit 
[28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1714) mode gz one to Move It Up 1 meter then back in object mode you can see it's scaling from the bottom now I'll look from the side and bring it up over here to where the hair is can just scale it 
[28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1726) down control 2 to give it a subdivision surface scale it up on the Z and then s shift Z to make it skinnier and I'm just trying to gauge the thickness it should be so the shape that I'm looking for is 
[28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1738) going to be something like this in edit mode make sure you're in x-ray mode also let's just bring this down quite a bit you can add one Loop in the center I'll move this a little like that and for the 
[29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1749) two ends I'll rotate them like this and that's going to get us a shape that's a little closer to this Arc over here can also scale down the end and if you want you can scale this up okay now back in 
[29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1760) object mode we can actually get this in place and start rotating shift d to duplicate scale it down shift d one more more time and we can bring it over here with G scale it down rotate it you know 
[29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1773) just line it up now let's make sure all of these have the scale applied with crl a apply the scale now in the reference these aren't actually going straightforward they're kind of sticking 
[29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1782) off to the side a little so we can mimic that by selecting the hair and rotating on the z-axis like that bring it to the side just a little and I want to keep the hair looking like it's kind of in 
[29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1793) the center so I'll just drag these few now if you want to stay organized it's probably a good idea to actually name all of these things so I'm just going to go through real fast and rename 
[30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1801) everything next we can work on the coat right here so for that I'm just going to actually duplicate the body scale it up a little and rename it with F2 I'll just name it coat this is still a cube so 
[30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1813) what I'm going to do is turn this down one subdivision like that and then apply it and then press control 2 to add another subdivision surface back in and I also want this to have a thickness to 
[30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1823) it so I'm going to add a solidify modifier and just make sure that this is at the top so that it's extruding and then smoothing that out now if I come into edit mode look from the front and 
[30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1833) I'm actually just going to delete the bottom point right here you can see that it does actually have a little bit of a thickness to it but let's make it even thicker like that I'll select the entire 
[30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1843) bottom Loop sz0 and that's just going to flatten it out on the z-axis we can bring this down to about here and scale it out if you want this to be more circular you can 
[30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1854) use the loop tools add-on for that again to get this collar what we can do is select the top Point press contrl plus and that's just going to expand the selection can press three to go into 
[31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1864) face select mode and I'm just going to inset this with I I don't want this to be individual so I'll press I again I'll right click go to Loop tools and circle extrude that up and I'm actually going 
[31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1876) to press X and delete the faces and that's just going to make it Hollow at the top also I want to select this top Loop so go into vertex select and we can just scale this out basically what I'm 
[31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1887) looking for for is that so it isn't cutting into the head really so I'm going to look from the side we can rotate it a little like that also maybe scale it out a little more I'm going to 
[31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1898) select some of these points and press GG to Loop slide to make this crease a little less sharp and I'm only focusing on one side because we're just going to mirror it after I'll bring this one down 
[31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1909) too and before doing the sleeve or deleting half and adding the mirror modifier um I'm going to work on this bottom part right here you can see in the reference it looks like there's kind 
[31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1919) of this um almost like an elastic waistband so to make that let's go back to edit mode I'll select the entire bottom Loop e to extrude S to scale and we'll just scale in and extrude down on 
[32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1931) the Z axis I'll select this entire Loop right here this middle one with alt and left click and we can just drag that up it will start to kind of uh cut through and you just have to move things around 
[32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1942) until it matches the shape a little better the bottommost loop we can scale that out a little bit also I'll select all of them and just uh start moving them around a little bit it looks like 
[32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1951) we're pretty close to the reference so let's go into edit mode xray mode and then delete half of this and we can add in the mirror modifier make sure that's at the very top and that merge is 
[32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1964) actually on now we can make the sleeve over here so for that I'll go into face select select these two faces I to inset right click and use Loop tools to make a circle right here I'll just scale that 
[32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1977) down so nothing is overlapping now from the front I don't really want this to go inward like that so I'll drag it out and I want to scale this down to be a little bit smaller right here and just going 
[33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1987) around where the arm is I'll press e and then X to extrude it outward like this sx0 and that will flatten it on the xais contrl r to add some Loop Cuts so we can get the shape of the sleeve a little 
[33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=1999) better and as we move it you can see that the loop is changing shape so if I want to match the shape of one side or the other you can press e and to switch sides you can press F so it's either 
[33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2009) going to copy the exact shape of one side or the exact shape of the other right here so I'll put it right there contrl R to add another loop right here and I forgot I actually want to delete 
[33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2019) these faces right here so that they're open now I can select these loops and scale them up like this if you want this cuff to be a little sharper you can do the same thing as I did for the 
[33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2030) waistband and kind of make them overlap like this this Loop right here I'll scale on the z-axis like that and drag it down a little you can do the same thing for for this one too if you want 
[34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2043) I'm also going to select this part and drag it in a little just to uh make it a little more triangular again make sure that the scale is applied and if anything changes you can adjust it to 
[34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2053) look how you want let's do the hands next so we can just select this right here tab into edit mode look from the top hands with the skin modifier is actually pretty easy extrude on the 
[34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2063) x-axis a little bit and then CR a to scale it down quite quite a bit as you can see I only have three fingers right here if you want you can add four you can add as many as you want really 
[34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2073) basically all you do is just extrude to the tip of the fingers right here or I guess the bottom of the fingers and then I'll select all of them right here I'm just going to press s x and zero to 
[34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2085) flatten them out on the x- axis and then e and X we can extrude it out I'll bring this out a little further and for the thumb we can extrude from the same point right about here and then e y press CR a 
[34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2099) to start scaling it up and you can see at some point it will start to actually connect everything together now we can just select all of the fingers so I'm using box select right here click and 
[35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2110) drag and holding shift and then crol a and you can just scale everything up until it's the thickness that you want another thing to pay attention to is the thumb placement so you can see as I move 
[35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2121) it the topology is going to change basically just try to avoid it um kinking and overlapping and stuff like this so that's it for the hands we can tab back into object mode and we can do 
[35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2131) the shoes next I'll add a subdivision surface with control 2 tab into edit mode face select I'll grab the front face right here look from the side and I'll just drag it out right about here 
[35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2142) I'll select these points and drag this out and I'm going to add a few Loops now so let's add a loop cut right here with crlr crl r again let's select these points right here move them down a 
[35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2153) little bit these ones right here and pull them up we can and just try to kind of match the shape of the reference over here we can add a loop cut with r right here another way instead of pressing E 
[36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2166) and F and stuff like that you can just bring it all the way to the bottom right here and then move it back up like that and it'll be flat also so this is for the bottom part of the shoe right here 
[36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2176) let's go into face select mode alt and left click to select this Loop of faces e to extrude S to scale and then shift Z so that it doesn't scale up on the you know the z- axis like that uh I also 
[36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2188) want to turn merging off so that it doesn't actually connect to the other shoe and to make it a little more even we can scale it on just the xais right there two to go into Edge select mode 
[36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2198) alt and left click right here and let's turn the mean crease all the way up for this like that now if you want you can adjust the thickness of this again with scaling on whatever axis until it looks 
[36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2208) good to you let's select this whole face loop again with alt and left click s and X we can scale that out a little bit to make these shoes a little chunkier I know the shoes are touching each other 
[36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2218) but I want them big and this is something that we can remedy when it gets to like rigging and uh setting poses and stuff like that but if this is bothering you you can go back into 
[37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2227) object mode and just scale them down you can also make the the character wider so their legs are further apart but in edit mode still I'm just going to select this face right here shift d to duplicate I 
[37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2239) to inset and we're going to delete this face with x the shortcut to select an entire separated piece of a mesh is L we're in face select so we can just hover over any face and press L and it 
[37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2249) will select that whole piece that we just made now we can just extrude that upward right here L again to select the whole thing we can scale this on the Y let's also scale this up and I'm just 
[37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2260) moving it into place right here if you got the thickness wrong you can always select this inner loop again with alt and left click to select those faces and then s shift Z and you can scale it all 
[37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2272) however you want for the tongue of the shoe right here I'm basically just going to select this face shift d to duplicate and I'll drag it up scale it down just a little bit we can add a loop cut you 
[38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2282) know to get the shape a little better we can scale this in you know scale uh individual edges right here I like to scale the middle one out a little it makes it much rounder then we can select 
[38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2293) this top part right here and try to kind of match this angle and the subdivision surface is actually smoothing this out quite a bit let's select these two faces and E to extrude to give this a little 
[38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2305) bit of a thickness like that if it's too thick or too thin you can press alt s to shrink or fatten it like that let's select this and rotate it more I'll press L to select the whole thing and we 
[38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2317) can move it into place last are the shorts and if you want you can skip this and just change the color of the legs to make it look more like tight pants but I kind of like the shorts so for those I'm 
[38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2327) actually going to use the shoes right here we can just duplicate that I'll press alt G to bring it back into the center tab into edit mode a to select everything X and we'll delete everything 
[38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2339) and add in a cube scale it down quite a bit and I'm just going to delete the bottom face right here so we can press X delete that face and I also want to add a solidify modifier so type in solidify 
[39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2351) and just make sure that that is above the subdivision surface right here back in object mode I'm just going to get this into place and be the size that I want before I actually apply the scale 
[39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2362) and mess with the solidify okay I think this is pretty close let's press contr a apply the scale and then we can come over to the solidify and we can change the thickness to be a little thicker and 
[39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2375) now we basically just have to move these faces around until we think that it looks good so let's just select the bottom Loop scale it out can also bring this up quite a bit higher all right 
[39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2386) back in object mode we can select everything rightclick and shade smooth the only thing that isn't going to be shaded smooth is what we made with the skin modifier and we should actually do 
[39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2397) duplicate this anyway so that we can apply it mainly because it's going to make it easier to texture paint when we get to that so let's press shift d to duplicate this and then we can find it 
[40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2406) in the outliner and we can just hide that right there let's select this one that's visible and we can apply the skin modifier right there so now if we tab into edit mode you can see that you know 
[40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2416) it's more than just a few edges we also have a ton of faces and thickness and whatnot now we should be able to right click it and shade smooth if you want to shade smooth with the skin modifier you 
[40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2425) just have to use this button right here the whiskers look kind of weird because they're shaded smooth even where it's supposed to be sharp right here so you used to be able to rightclick and shade 
[40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2435) Smooth by angle but now it's a little different just select the whiskers go to the modifier panel and under normals we have Smooth by angle and that's just going to clear it right up for you next 
[40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2446) we can add some color there are a lot of ways to add color in materials and I'll be showing how to use this color palette method but you could also use texture painting you could make a separate 
[40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2455) material for each color you want and then select and assign those materials to different parts of the model you can find free textures from a site like poly Haven then use the node Wrangler add-ons 
[41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2465) shift controlt shortcut to set them up fast or you can use a separate program like substance painter now I'm not going to cover all of these things but at least you'll know what to search for if 
[41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2475) you want to learn more so you can download this color palette for free from gumroad and then just come back here to set up the color palette we should go into the shading tab up here 
[41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2484) I'll select the head and then we can press new right here all we have to do is bring in the image texture so let's press shift a and you can just search image and choose image texture then 
[41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2495) press open and find the texture pette that you just downloaded so it might be in your downloads folder mine is over here and then we can just press open now just drag the color into the base color 
[41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2504) right here make sure this is set to closest you can also give the material a name and that's it now we just have to add this material to everything else so with this still selected you can press a 
[41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2515) contrl l and then you can press linked materials and that should add it to everything else now let's go over to the UV editing tab up here just make sure you turn on material preview so you can 
[42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2525) actually see the colors properly and we want to see our pallette over here so press this button up at the top and make sure you choose the pallette anything that we made with the skin modifier 
[42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2534) isn't going to be unwrapped so what you can do is just select everything tab into edit mode press a to select everything over here in the viewport and we can press U and for this method it 
[42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2543) doesn't matter too much what the UV map looks like most people will use Smart UV project and I usually just set the island margin to something like 0.5 and press enter and that should be 
[42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2554) fine let's reset everything to White so come over to the UV editor press a to select everything s to scale and zero and everything will scale down to this single point over here and then you can 
[42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2564) press G to move it around and you can see as I do that all of the colors are changing and that is basically how you change the colors over here we can tab back into object mode basically you just 
[42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2574) select any of the objects tab back into edit mode a to select everything and then over here in the UV editor you can just move this around to change the color and whatever you put it on top of 
[43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2585) that's the color that it's going to be I'll put it somewhere around here you can also select multiple things at a time so I know I want some other things to be orange I'm just going to shift and 
[43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2594) left click on everything that I want to be orange I'll choose the eyebrows and I'll choose the body tab into edit mode a to select everything and you can see now we have a DOT on white and one on 
[43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2605) orange because we already Chang change part of it to Orange so what you can do is just click and drag to select this over here and then G and just move it to the same spot I want the eyebrows to be 
[43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2615) a darker color orange so I'll press alt a to deselect everything I can hover over the eyebrow and press l so now we can come over here and press G and Y and let's just move this up right there 
[43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2626) let's select the pupil and the mouth tab into edit mode press a to select everything let's make this black back in object mode I'll select this mouth part with the whiskers I want to select only 
[43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2637) the whiskers so I'll go into vertex select and x-ray mode and I'll just shift and drag to select just the tips then Control Plus on the numpad to select everything go back into face 
[44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2648) select and then we can just drag this down to make these black I want the nose and the inner ear to be the same color so I'll select the nose and shift select the head in object mode tab into edit 
[44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2659) mode alt Z to turn xray mode off we can select the nose and let's select these two faces right here over here I'll press a s and zero to scale those to the same point and we can put both of these 
[44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2673) over to like a pale pink color like that I don't like how the ear looks I think this should be a little sharper in here so we can go into edit mode press n to open this side panel and instead of the 
[44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2682) faces I just want the outer edges so let's go into Edge select mode and we can deselect this with shift click and let's turn mean crease up until we like the size so I think right around 0.5 
[44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2693) looks pretty good and we can tab back into object mode and press n to make that panel go away let's select the coat right here a to select everything let's make this also a purpley color and a 
[45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2705) little more pale tab back into object mode select the shorts a to select everything let's make this uh a little darker back in object mode select the shoes tab into edit mode I want this 
[45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2718) part of the shoe to be the same color as the coat so what we can do is maybe let's select everything else it might be easier to do that so in face select mode all and left click right here to select 
[45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2730) that Loop contrl plus to grow the selection can hover over this and press L and the same thing with the tongue and now we can press control I and that should invert the selection so we have 
[45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2740) the bottom of the shoe also which is fine now in object mode I'm going to shift select this go back into edit mode now we can actually see both so let's just select the white part and move it 
[45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2751) to the same spot I think this part and that part should be white but maybe let's select the tongue and make it the same color as the nose back in object mode select the shoe shift select the 
[46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2762) nose like that and we can drag the white part to this color over here so they're the same and that's it for the color this method is pretty easy for blocking out solid colors with objects like this 
[46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2774) but if you're texture painting it might be a little easier if all of these are joined together so let's just go back to the layout tab right here and I'll show you how to apply all of the modifiers at 
[46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2784) once and join everything together what I would suggest is turning down the subdivision surface as low as you think it can go so you could turn all of these to one another thing you can also do is 
[46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2795) press a to select everything and then hold alt while you press this and you can turn all of them down at the same time obviously this looks too low poly but we could turn it up by one maybe and 
[46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2806) that actually looks all right then what we can do is right click still with everything selected we can go to convert to mesh right here and that's kind of a quick way of applying all of the 
[46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2817) modifiers and to join all of these together what you can do is just select one of the objects again press a to select everything and contrl J and when you do that the actively selected object 
[47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2828) the one that is outlined in like a yellow lighter color that's the object that all of them will be joined to so you can see over here everything was joined to the coat now if you want to 
[47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2836) smooth this back out you can just press control1 to add a subdivision surface to everything again and that's why I think it's good to set the subdivision surface to as low as you think it and go because 
[47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2847) you can always add one back on top sorry what was that this isn't enough and you want to see the character move well to make that happen you'll have to learn about rigging I actually have a whole 
[47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2857) playlist about it and I'm planning on making a video soon where I actually rig the character from this video thanks for watching and have a good one [Music] 
[47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6HQhs-gk50&t=2879) la

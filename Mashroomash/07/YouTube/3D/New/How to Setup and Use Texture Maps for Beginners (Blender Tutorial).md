# Transcript
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=0) in this tutorial I'll show you how to properly set up texture maps in blender for beginners and then after I show you how to properly set up texture Maps within a material I'll also show you a 
[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=10) really cool feature in blender which will automatically set up all the texture maps in the material but I think it's really important that you know the basic fundamentals of how to set up all 
[00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=18) the texture Maps so that you can edit the material if you need to or fix any problems that you might have so I will be showing you the method of how to auto set up the textures after I show you the 
[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=27) fundamentals of setting up texture maps in blender so to show you how to properly set up all the texture Maps we're going to be setting up the following so we'll be setting up a 
[00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=35) wooden floor and for that we'll be using the color map roughness map and normal map and then to show you how to set up a metallic map we're going to be adding a metal material to a monkey head and then 
[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=44) to show you how to set up the transparent map we're going to be adding in this Leaf texture and then also to show you how to set up an emission map we'll be using this building which has 
[00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=53) glowing windows so by the end of this video you'll know how to set up the following Maps the color roughness normal metallic transparent and emission Maps now I'm not going to cover how to 
[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=65) set up displacement maps in this video because I've actually created two other tutorials on how to set up displacement maps and I'll have the links in the description to those two tutorials if 
[01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=74) you'd like to check them out and one of those tutorials is how to set up displacements using the displacement modifier and then the other tutorial is how to set up the displacements within 
[01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=83) the material and if you find this tutorial helpful and you'd like to help support me and this channel then some great ways to do that or by checking out my gumroad store and my patreon page 
[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=92) where you can get access to 3D models and assets tutorial files artwork project files procedural materials and much more blender content on my gummert and patreon and if you'd like to support

[01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=110) monthly and you'll get some cool perks here on YouTube and you can also use the super thanks feature here on YouTube to send me a little tip if you enjoy this tutorial now if you want to use the same 
[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=119) exact texture maps that I'll be using then I'll have the links in the description to four different texture maps that I'll be using in this video and they're all completely free and I'll 
[02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=127) be downloading them from a really great texture website called ambient CG so ambient CG is an amazing texture website for getting many high quality free textures so the first texture I'll be 
[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=138) downloading is this wooden floor from ambient CG now you can see right over here there are many different download options now you can download jpg versions of the texture or jpeg versions 
[02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=149) I usually download jpeg versions because the jpeg versions are a smaller file size now the size here you can see there is 1K 2K and all the way up to 16k I usually download 4K textures because I 
[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=161) think that's a good balance between a high quality texture but also not being too high of a file size because if you're always using 16k textures that is going to be very high detail so if 
[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=172) you're doing close-up shots that can work really well but because it's such a large image blender will use much more memory when you're rendering however if you only use 1K then it probably will 
[03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=181) look kind of blurry and pixelated unless you're very far away from the texture in the render so I'll be downloading the 4K jpeg so you can just click on this and download a zip file and then to show you 
[03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=191) how to set up metallic Maps I'll also be downloading this metal material and it has a little bit of rust on it and again I'll be downloading the JPEG and I'll be downloading the 4K version now to show 
[03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=201) you how to set up transparent Maps I'll be downloading this Leaf texture because the leaf texture has transparency around it and that way you can cut out a low poly mesh when you're creating some sort 
[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=211) of nature object and then it will have transparency on the edge and so that way the leaf will look sharper and higher quality on the edge and again for this texture I'll be downloading the 4K jpeg 
[03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=221) version and then finally to show you how to set up emission Maps I'll be downloading this building texture because the windows of the building are actually emitting light and I'll be 
[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=230) downloading the 4K JPEG and I did want to mention that ambient CG does have a patreon page so if you enjoy their free textures and you'd like to help support ambient CG then def definitely check out 
[04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=240) their patreon page I'll have a link in the description and that's a great way to help support ambient cge so here I am in my downloads folder and here are all the downloaded textures and they're 
[04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=250) downloaded as zip files and also if you're unfamiliar with my file browser that is because I use the Linux Mint operating system so when you're downloading textures online to use in 
[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=260) your blender projects I highly recommend making a folder and just name it textures and then put all your different textures into that folder because if you just save all the textures in your 
[04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=269) downloads folder and leave it there then it might get cluttered up with other things you've downloaded and also if you move the texture somewhere else on your computer then the blender file won't 
[04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=277) know where the textures are located because you move them and so you'll have to add back in the textures into blender so I'd recommend making a dedicated textures folder on your computer and 
[04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=286) then just keeping all the textures in that same place so I'm gonna just select all the zip files and then I'll right click and then I can just click on extract here and if you're using the 
[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=295) Windows or Mac operating systems then the extract option should work the same way way so you can just right click and then you can extract the zip files so then if you want to you can select the 
[05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=304) zip files and you can just delete them so now we have the different folders with all of the different texture Maps so before we actually set these up in blender I want to quickly go over all of 
[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=314) the different texture Maps so that you know what they are so I'll be going into the wood floor folder so in the folder you can see there's this preview here this may not come with all the textures 
[05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=323) that you download but I'm just going to delete this because I don't need it and then also these files here we're not going to be using these in blender so I'm just going to delete them so I'm now 
[05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=332) going to go through each one of the texture maps and explain what they do so here's the first one this one is the color map so I'll just open this up so the main texture map that you'll use is 
[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=341) the color map now sometimes the color map is called color Albedo base color or diffuse but they all are just the base color in this case this texture map is called color so the color ramp is very 
[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=353) easy to understand because you're going to be plugging the color map into the base color of the Shader to tell it what the color others are actually going to be now another texture map that many 
[06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=362) materials will come with is a displacement map now not every material comes with it but some materials will come with a displacement map and as I mentioned earlier I won't be showing you 
[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=372) how to set up displacement maps in this video because I already have two other tutorials on it and I'll have the link in the description to those tutorials so with a displacement map you'll plug the 
[06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=381) displacement texture into the displacement of the Shader and the displacement map is going to tell it if it's going to pop out more or pop back in So if the texture is darker that's 
[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=391) telling the material to push the vertices back into the mesh and if the texture is lighter that's telling the material to push the vertices out of the mesh so you can see here the crevices 
[06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=402) and creases in the floorboards are darker to push it back in but then the rest of the material is lighter now a very common map that most materials use is the roughness map so if you plug the 
[06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=413) roughness map up to the roughness of the material the dark areas are going to be more reflective but the light areas are going to be more rough so you can see here on this wood material the wood 
[07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=422) floor is a bit shiny here where it is a bit smooth and flat but then here in the crevices it gets a bit lighter and so that's going to make it more rough and then another very common texture is the 
[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=432) normal map so the normal map is a fake bump so the normal map will make it appear as though the material is Bumpy but unlike the displacement textures it's not actually going to displace the 
[07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=444) mesh so the object's geometry won't be affected but it'll appear as though the material has all these little bumps so if you plug the normal map into the normal of the Shader it's going to make 
[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=453) the creases in the floorboards look like they're going back in and then the other part of the Fuller boards is going to pop out now some materials which you download online will come with two 
[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=463) different normal maps and if the material just comes with one single normal map you can just use the normal map that it comes with but it might come with a normal DX and a normal GL and so 
[07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=474) you might be wondering which one you want to use in blender now if you'd like to learn more about the difference is between normal DX and normal GL then I highly recommend checking out this 
[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=484) article from polygon written by Andrew price also known as blender Guru so blender Guru has his own texture website called polygon I'll link to that in the description and I'll also have a link in 
[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=495) the description to this article but basically different rendering engines are created to work better with different normal maps and so if I scroll right down here on the article you can 
[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=504) see cycles and EV cycles and Eevee are the two rendering engines in blender and those work best with opengl so if you're using blender and if you're using the Cycles rendering engine or the EV 
[08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=515) rendering engine you should just make sure to use the opengl so now I'll go out of the wood floor folder and I'm going to go over here to the metal material and I'll just make these bigger 
[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=524) and you can see this metal material has pretty much all the same textures but this one has a metallic map and so if you plug the metallic map up to the metallic of the Shader it's going to 
[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=534) tell it what parts are going to be metal and what parts are not going to be metal so if the Shader is more white that's telling it that it'll be more metal but if it's more black that's telling it 
[09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=543) that it's not going to be metal so this metal texture here has some rusty areas and the rusty parts are not metallic so you can see the rust is darker but then the rest of the material is lighter so 
[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=553) it is treated as metal then I'll go out of that metal folder and I'll go into the leaf folder and you can see just like the other materials it has a normal map and a roughness map and some other 
[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=562) Maps but this Leaf texture also has an opacity map and again Alpha transparency transparent or opacity they're all going to mean the same thing they're basically just meaning transparent and so if you 
[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=574) plug the opacity up to the alpha or the transparency of the material the black areas are telling it that it's going to be transparent and the white areas are telling it that it's not going to be 
[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=584) transparent and then finally I'll go out of that folder and I'm going to go into the building folder and so again you can see this one has the same things it has the roughness and the normals and all 
[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=593) the other textures but you can see this one also has an emission and so the emission map is going to be a meeting light from the material so if you plug the emission map into the emission of 
[10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=604) the Shader the black areas are not going to be emitting light at all but then anything with color is going to be emitting light and so you can see here on this building texture there's going 
[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=612) to be light coming out of the windows of the buildings and so that'll be emitting light alright so now that we've gone over all the texture Maps let's finally set these up in blender so I will just 
[10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=622) press the a key a few times to select everything I'll hit the X key to delete and let's just click on delete I'll now press shift a for the add menu let's go to mesh and I'm going to add a plane and 
[10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=634) I'll be using this plane to set up the wooden floor now I also want to have some nice realistic lighting to preview the material so if I hold down the Z button and move my mouse up into the 
[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=643) rendered view you can see the background is all black and so I'm going to be using blender's built-in hdris now the built-in hdri's won't actually show up in the render but it will show up in the 
[10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=653) preview I'll hold down the Z button go into the rendered View and then if you click right here you can go to the shading options we want to uncheck the scene world and this way you can click 
[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=663) right here and you can choose some different hdris which are built into blender and so I can just add this one for now and you can also change the strength of it and then also I will 
[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=672) press shift a and I'm going to go down here to light and I'm just going to add a sunlight and I'll move the sunlight up and just kind of rotate it over here rotate it at an angle and then here on 
[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=682) the object data properties I could turn the strength up of the light maybe to just like a three so we just have a very basic lighting setup to preview the shading so now let's set up the 
[11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=691) materials by selecting the object and then you can click right over here on the shading workspace and the shading workspace might look a little bit different for you because I've 
[11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=700) customized blender but basically right over here there's going to be the Shader editor and then right over here there's going to be the 3D viewport and if you want to do this in the normal layout 
[11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=709) view you can click back here on the layout workspace and what you can do is click up here in the corner when the Crosshair appears and you can click and then drag over and that will split the 
[11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=718) window and then you can change the editor type by clicking right here and you can change it to the Shader editor and also the shading options are also right over here on the material 
[12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=729) Properties by clicking right here but the material properties won't allow you to edit the Shader nodes so it is better to use the Shader editor I'm going to close this by just clicking here and 
[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=738) clicking dragging over and then letting go to just close that window and I'm going to click here on the shading workspace instead and I can just drag this down to make it a little bit 
[12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=746) smaller and I'll drag this over here and I'll hold down the Z button and move my mouse up into the rendered viewport mode and also I need to scroll right over here and I need to do the same thing in 
[12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=756) this window because we switched workspaces so I'm going to scroll over here and then click on the shading options and I will turn off the scene world and then if I click right here to 
[12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=767) change the HDR I could just maybe use this one here so make sure you have the object selected and you need to add a new material to the object so you can just click on the new button right here 
[12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=775) and then I can click here to rename the material and I'm just going to rename it to wood so you can see here in blender the default Shader is the principled Shader and if you also click here on the 
[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=785) material properties you can control the printable Shader right over here and so there's going to be many different options like the base color you can also see there's roughness values and normal 
[13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=794) values and there's many other sliders now if this Shader looks a bit complicated don't worry because most of these options you're not going to change most of these options you'll just leave 
[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=804) at the default so you can edit the material by like taking the base color here and making it a color so I could like make this a blue color and also you can see how shiny this is so there is 
[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=814) like a roughness value here I could turn this down to make it less rough and now it is more shiny or I could make it more rough so you can play around with the shading options on the printable Shader 
[13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=824) but I'm instead going to be showing you how to add in image textures instead so what you can do to add an image texture is press shift a for the add menu you can go to here to the search and you can 
[13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=834) search for the image texture node and we want to drop the image texture node right here here so now you can click on new to create a new image or you can click on open and this will allow you to 
[14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=844) open up an image from your file browser so let's just click on open and then in blender's file browser you can locate to wherever you've saved the textures and I'm going to go here into the wood floor 
[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=854) and I'm going to start by selecting the color and then you can click on open image to add this in now another easier way to do this is to just open up your file browser on your computer and I have 
[14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=865) my file browser on another monitor and you can just click and drag and you can drop the texture from your file browser into blender and then that will add it in so that is just an easier way to do 
[14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=875) that so we now want to put the wood floor texture on the Shader so you can see on all the nodes there are these different sockets here and you can drag out wires from the sockets and you can 
[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=885) plug them up to the other sockets so we want to take the color data from this texture and we want to put that into the base color of the printable Shader and generally speaking you do want the same 
[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=896) color to be plugging into the same color so the yellow one here that that is color data you can see here its base color that is also yellow then there's also these gray ones and that is just 
[15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=904) black and white data for instance the roughness is just black and white because the lighter or darker values will tell it to be more rough or more shiny and then there's also these purple 
[15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=913) ones here and the purple ones are either normal data displacement data or vector data so let's go right up here and we want to take the color and we want to plug that into the base color so now 
[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=924) instead of using a single color it's telling it that it's going to use this texture and so now if I look around here you can see it looks like a wood floor now there are also a bunch of different 
[15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=932) settings here on the image texture node but again most of these settings you're not going to change I will go over a few things though if you want to get rid of the texture you can click on the exit 
[15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=942) button to get rid of it also you can click on this file icon here if you want to add in a new image texture and you can also click here on the drop down and the drop down will show you all the 
[15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=951) textures which are in the blender file so so far we only have that one wood floor color and then another really important thing to know is the color space right here so the color space is 
[16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=962) pretty easy to understand basically if the texture is contributing to the color of the material then you want to leave the color space at the default which is srgb and the RGB in the srgb stands for 
[16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=975) red green and blue so this is for anything which is contributing to the color of the Shader however if you're using any other map which isn't contributing to the base color for 
[16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=985) instance a roughness map or a displacement map or a normal map or even a metallic map for all of those shaders you'll want to set the color space to non-color and I'll be going over this 
[16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=996) later in the video when we set up the other Maps so just remember if it's contributing to the color it's going to be the srgb but then any other Maps we'll be using the Anon color because 
[16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1005) it's non-color data and you may be wondering why this is important to do and why it is important is because if you don't set the proper maps to non-color then the Shader won't actually 
[16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1016) look correct so there can be some problems in glitch is with the displacement map if you don't set it to non-color and with the roughness map the roughness values aren't actually going 
[17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1024) to be correct so if you don't set these up correctly then the Shader may look a bit off now another really important thing that we need to go over is how the 2D texture is placed on the 3D object 
[17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1035) and to tell a 2D image texture how it's going to be placed on a 3D object it uses what's called UV mapping and to see the UV mapping of an object you can click right over here to go to the UV 
[17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1047) editing workspace and so there's going to be the UV editor right over here and there's going to be the 3D viewport right over here and in the UV editor here if you don't see the texture then 
[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1057) you can click right here on the drop down and it'll show you all the textures which are in the blender file and you can select that wood material so here in the 3D viewport you want to make sure 
[17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1066) that you are in edit mode by hitting the Tab Key and so when you go into edit mode you can edit the UV mapping and I'm also going to hold down the Z button and I'll move my mouse down into the 
[17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1077) material previews that I can preview them at material now when you download image textures they are usually square but this wood texture you can see is actually a rectangle and so because of 
[18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1087) that the default UV unwrapping of the object kind of stretched it out so I'm going to re-uv unwrap this object so what I can do is press the a key to select the entire mesh and then I'll hit 
[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1097) the U button and I'm going to click on unwrap and so that is going to re-unwrap it and so basically these vertices here they are going to be displayed right over here when you select them so then 
[18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1108) right over here in the UV editor you can press the a key to select the UV editing and you can hit G to grab or R to rotate and S to scale and so wherever the UV mapping is placed on the texture that is 
[18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1121) where it's going to show up on the 3D object now uvn wrapping is a much larger topic which I'm not going to go over completely in this video so if you'd like to learn the basics of UV 
[18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1131) unwrapping then definitely check out my UV unwrapping for beginners tutorial where I show you all the basics of uvn wrapping in blender and if your object doesn't have any UV unwrapping then you 
[19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1141) won't be able to see the texture on the mesh so it is really important that all of your objects are UV unwrapped so we can now click right back here on the shading workspace to preview the 
[19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1150) material again so on default the image textures always use the UV mapping of the object however you can actually tell the textures to use a different method of placing it on the object and that is 
[19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1161) controlled by this Vector value right here now to actually change how the texture is placed on the object using the vector I'm going to be turning on the Node Wrangler add-on so if you don't 
[19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1171) have the node Wrangler add-on enabled you can click on edit and you can go to the preferences and then over there in the add-ons tab just search for node Wrangler and you can check mark the node 
[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1180) Wrangler add-on so now that we have the node Wrangler enabled you can select the image texture and then you can press Ctrl T and Ctrl T is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes you 
[19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1192) can also press shift a go here to the search and you can search for these different nodes but it's really easy to just use this shortcut key from the node Wrangler add-on so it's going to add 
[20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1202) these two nodes and the first node is going to tell the texture how it's placed on the object now as I mentioned on default if you don't have anything plugged up to the vector it is just 
[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1212) going to use the UV mapping of the object but if I plug this back up here now I can choose between these different options so normally you are just going to use UV and if you're creating a 
[20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1223) procedural material usually you'll use the object coordinates because that works best but there are many types of coordinates here and you don't actually need the mapping nodes if I drag the 
[20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1232) mapping node down here you could just plug the UV into the vector but there's some different ones here like you you can use the normal and the generated but again for most things you're just going 
[20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1241) to use the UV mapping when you're setting up texture maps and if you're creating a procedural material then you would probably want to use object but why I want to show this is because of 
[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1250) this mapping node so I'm going to drag the mapping node up here and let's put the vector into the vector so because the UV is going through the mapping the mapping has the location rotation and 
[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1261) scale values and you can change these values to transform the wood material so if I want to change the location I can drag this around and this is not actually affecting the UV map because 
[21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1271) it's first taking the UV map and then it's using the mapping node to change where the texture is so I can change the location I could also change the rotation if I want to rotate this and 
[21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1280) for this case I would want to rotate it on the z-axis to kind of rotate that around and then there also is the scale value and if you want to scale all of the values at the same time instead of 
[21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1289) just scaling one value then you can click and then drag down and then you can drag back and forth and this way it'll change the X Y and Z size all at once so this is a really easy way to 
[21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1299) transform the material if you don't want to change the UV mapping alright so we'll now add in the next texture which is the roughness texture so you can press shift a go to the search and you 
[21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1308) can search for an image texture or you can just drag and drop the texture from your file browser so I'm going to drag and drop in the roughness map and you can see it's been added just like this 
[21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1317) one as an image tag texture so now we can take this color here and we can put this into the roughness and I did mention earlier that generally you want to take these yellow dots and you want 
[22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1327) to put them into other yellow dots but black and white data can also be used as color data because black and white are colors as well and so you can actually take this color here even though this is 
[22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1337) yellow you can put it into the gray dot which is just black and white data and it will just use the lighter values and the darker values so we want to put this wood floor roughness into the roughness 
[22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1347) to control where it's going to be more rough and where it's going to be more shiny and then also if you want to I can drag these nodes back here and I can put the vector of the mapping into the 
[22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1356) vector of the roughness here so that it's using the UVS and it's using the same mapping size so now if I look around here in the 3D viewport you can see it does look like a very shiny wood 
[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1365) floor but something is kind of off it kind of looks too shiny and that is because of the color space as I mentioned earlier with this color map so again any texture which isn't 
[22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1376) contributing to the base color or the material needs to to be set to non-color so because this is a roughness map we want to take the color space we want to change this to non-color and now that 
[23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1386) looks much more like a wood floor so you can still see it is quite reflective but it's not quite as shiny and so that is looking really good and if I zoom up very close you can see some parts are a 
[23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1395) little bit more shiny whereas other parts are a little bit more rough and that looks quite realistic so this is starting to look like a wood floor but if you look really closely you can see 
[23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1402) it looks very flat and it kind of just looks like this is a wood floor image which was printed out on a piece of paper because it doesn't have any bump data so we're now going to be adding in 
[23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1412) the normal map so I'm just going to drag and drop it from my file browser and again as I mentioned earlier in this video when you're using the Cycles rendering engine or the EV rendering 
[23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1422) engine you want to use the normal GL so if you have multiple versions of the normal map the normal DX or the normal GL you want to use the normal GL 4 Cycles or EV so I'm just going to drag 
[23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1433) this in here and then to plug it up to the normal we want to take the color here and we want to put that into the normal now there is a problem with this this here is a yellow dot so that is 
[24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1443) color data then this here is a purple Dot and that is a normal data and so if I look around here on the material you can see it kind of is working it kind of looks bumpy but there's some really 
[24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1451) weird shading issues and so we need to actually add a node here to convert the color data into normal data that the Shader can use so to do that I want to press shift a and I'll go here to the 
[24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1461) search and I'm going to search for a normal map node and let's put the normal map node in between the normal texture and the Shader so just drop it here and so since I dropped it in here now you 
[24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1472) can see the color is going into the color of the normal map and the normal map is converting it to normal data and then that can go into the normal so the normal map is a converter because it 
[24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1481) inputs color data but then it outputs normal data and then if you want to you can also take this mapping here and plug that up in to the vector so they're all using the same mapping now if you look 
[24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1492) around here you can see something still doesn't look quite correct and that is again because this normal texture isn't contribute beating to the base color of the material so here on the color space 
[25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1501) we want to change this to a non-color just like we did with the roughness map so now if I kind of look here on the side and look closely at the wood you can see it's now looking much more 
[25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1511) photorealistic because the grains of wood actually look bumpy and then the creases here within the planks actually are going back in so that is how you properly set up the color map the 
[25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1520) roughness map and the normal map but there's actually a feature in blender which will automatically set up all the texture maps for us so I'm going to select this object in the 3D viewport 
[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1530) I'll just press the H key to hide it and then I'll press shift a and I'm going to go here to mesh and just add a monkey head and then I want to make the monkey head smooth so I'll go here to the 
[25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1541) modifier properties I can click on ADD modifier and I'll just add the subdivision surface modifier and I can turn the levels viewport up to two and then also here in the 3D viewport using 
[25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1551) the object context menu I can just click on shade smooth so I'm going to be adding the metal textures to this monkey head so I will click on new right here now to have blender automatically set up 
[26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1561) all the texture maps for us you want to select the printable Shader and then you want to make sure that you have the node Wrangler enabled so I talked about it earlier in this video but if you don't 
[26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1570) have the node Wrangler enabled you can click here on edit and go to the preferences and then click on the add-ons Tab and you can search for node Wrangler and just check mark the node 
[26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1579) Wrangler add-on so with the add-on enabled I'll select the printable Shader and then I'm going to press Ctrl shift T and when you press Ctrl shift T that will bring up blender's file browser and 
[26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1589) I'm going to locate to the metal texture folder so I now want to select the textures so I want to select the normal GL and then hold down the control key and we can select the color and then you 
[26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1601) can also select the roughness and there is a metallic map or a metalness map but I'm going to show you how to set that up manually because that's what I'm showing you in this tutorial just select the 
[26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1611) normal color and roughness and then I can click on principled texture setup so you can see now it is automatically set up all the texture Maps it's added in the normal map and it's also added in 
[27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1621) this mapping here with the UVS and also it's added in these nice little frames so I can click on the frames and drag them around if you don't want the frames though you can select the frame and then 
[27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1630) just press X to delete it and that'll delete the frame now how the principal texture setup works is it detects the name in the material and it's looking for these different names so you can see 
[27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1641) it says color right here and also in this one it says roughness and also this one says normal so if the image textures are not named correctly then the printable texture setup and blender may 
[27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1651) not work correctly and so you might need to rename the image textures on your computer and then try it again or you can just manually add in any of the textures now there is a problem with 
[27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1660) this material and that is that it doesn't look metallic now you could just take this metallic value here and you could turn it all the way up to one so now it looks like metal but you can see 
[27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1669) there's some rusty areas where it is not going to be metal so what I'm going to do is click and drag to box select these nodes and I'm going to drag them down so I have more space and I now want to add 
[27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1678) the metal map right here so I'm just going to click and drag from my file browser and drop in the metalness map and it might be called metallic or might be called metalness and I will use the 
[28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1688) same mapping so I'm going to take this reroute here and just plug it up to the vector so it's using the same mapping so now we can take this color here from the metalness and we can put that into the 
[28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1697) metallic and that'll tell it where it's going to be metal and where it's not going to be metal so you can see it is shiny right over there but then right there where the rust is it's not very 
[28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1705) shiny and then again because this isn't contributing to the base color of the material you want to take the color space and you want to change this to non-color and you can see when we use 
[28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1714) blender's principle texture setup using the node Wrangler it automatically set these to non-color data but I did just want to show you how to set this up manually because it's important to 
[28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1723) remember to use the non-colored data so that is how you set up the metallic map so I'm now going to show you how to set up the transparency so let's select the monkey head I'll press h to hide that 
[28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1733) object then I can press shift a and I'll go to mesh and I'm going to add a plane again and then let's click click here to add a new material and I could call this material like Leaf so again I'll be 
[29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1743) using the printable texture setup so I'm going to select the principal Shader and I'll press Ctrl shift T and this time I'll locate to the folder with the leaves and so I'm going to select the 
[29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1753) normal you can see this one just comes with a normal map so just use the normal map that it comes with and also hold down the control key I'll select the color and also the roughness and it 
[29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1763) doesn't come with a metallic map now it also comes with this opacity here so if you're using the printable texture setup you can also select the opacity but I want to show you how to set it up 
[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1771) manually in case you ever need to so I'm just going to do the roughness the color and the normal so I'll click on printable texture setup you can see it's set up all the textures now the problem 
[29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1781) with this is that it hasn't added the opacity or the transparency so what I'm going to do is just select the frames and hit the X key to delete them click on this Frame and X to delete it and you 
[29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1791) can see right down here there is an alpha value and so this Alpha value is going to tell it where it's going to be transparent so I can click and drag to select these nodes and let's just drag 
[30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1801) them down and then if I go to my file browser I just want to click and drag and drop in the opacity map or the transparent map I can drop it here and then again I want to click on this here 
[30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1813) let's drag out a wire and stick that into the vector so it's using the mapping and the texture coordinate and then again just like all these other textures it's not contributing to the 
[30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1821) color so let's take the color space here and we want to change this to non-color so now this color here can go into the alpha so the black values are telling it to be transparent and the light values 
[30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1833) are telling it not to be transparent now if you're using blender EV then this may not work on default and so in blender EV there are a few other settings that you need to change in the material to get 
[30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1843) the transparency to work so if you're using transparency in EV and it's not working correctly then you can check out my other tutorial which I will have in the description on how to use 
[30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1852) transparency maps in blender EV so link to that will be in the description so I'll now show you how to set up a mission Maps so I'll select this object I'll press h to hide it I'll press shift 
[31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1862) a and for this one I'm just going to add a cube I can click on new to add a new material on the cube and I can just rename this to building and then again I'll use the same principal texture 
[31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1873) setup so I'll select the principled Shader and I'll press Ctrl shift T So then again in the file browser in my downloads folder I'm going to go into the building folder and then I can 
[31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1884) select the textures so I'll select the normal GL also the color and the roughness and then you can select the emission map but I'm going to show you how to set it up automatically so I'll 
[31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1894) click on printable texture setup and then if you want to you can click here on the frames and press X to delete them I usually keep them because they're kind of nice but I'll just delete them in 
[31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1903) this case now I do want to change the size of the UV editing so let's click here on the UV editing layout and then I'll press the a key to select the UV editing and I'll just scale it up so it 
[31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1914) is much bigger and then here if I look on the side I actually want to rotate this so so I will hit R to rotate here in the UV editor I can type in 90 and then enter so it's rotated over so now 
[32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1925) you can see the side of the cube looks like a building so I'll just click right back over here to the shading workspace all right so I now want to make these windows actually be emitting light so 
[32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1936) what I'm going to do is click and drag to select these two nodes and I can drag them down so I have more space and you can see there is this emission value right here and there's also an emission 
[32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1945) strength so if the value is black that is not going to be emitting at all but then if you turn the value up if it's lighter it's actually going to be emitting light and then the emission 
[32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1953) strength here is just going to control the parts which are actually emitting light so again in my file browser here on my other monitor I'm going to go to the building and I'm just going to click 
[32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1962) and drag and drop the emission map right here into blender and it might also be abbreviated to emit in this case it is emission so again let's take the mapping here plug that up to the vector and then 
[32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1974) we can take the color and we can plug that up to the emission so now you can see it looks like there's light coming from those buildings and to see this better I'm going to scroll over here and 
[33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1984) I'm going to click here on the shading and I can take the strength and I can turn that way down so now it is very dark and I can also select this light here I'll just hit X and click on delete 
[33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=1995) so now you can see it's basically like a nighttime scene if I click here on the shading to preview this I will actually click here to change this and I could maybe make it this one here so this is a 
[33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2005) daytime one and I can turn the strength down so it is very dark and also I can turn the opacity up so now you can see that it's kind of nighttime or maybe evening and so it looks very dark and 
[33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2014) the windows are emitting light and then if you want to change the strength of the emission you can just drag the submission strength so you can make it brighter but if you make it too bright 
[33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2023) it's going to start to be blown out so probably for most things I'll just leave the emission strength at one and so that is it that is how you set up the emission map now there is something that 
[33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2032) you may have noticed and that is that we left the color space set to srgb and that is because the emission map is actually contributing to the color of the material so the base color is 
[34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2043) contributing to the color of the material obviously but the emission map is also giving color to those windows so for the emission map we want to leave the color space set to srgb now there's 
[34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2053) one more thing I want to go over in this video and that is how to edit the texture Maps so I've just added back in this wood floor here and I want to show you how you can edit the different Maps 
[34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2063) so you can see there is the color here and the colors going into the base color but we can actually add nodes in between the color and the principal Shader to actually edit the colors so if I press 
[34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2073) shift a I can go here to the search and for instance I could search for the RGB curves and I could drop this in here between the color and the Shader so I could click here on R for red I could 
[34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2084) click here to add a DOT and drag this up here into the corner and you can see it's going to add more red or here on the C for color I could turn this down to make it darker or lighter and I can 
[34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2093) edit the material you could also press shift a go to the search and you could search for like the brightness and contrast drop this here and I could change the brightness of the material 
[35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2102) and also the contrast and then also for the roughness here let's say you want to make this wood floor a little bit more shiny well the light and dark values are going to make it more shiny or more 
[35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2112) rough so I can press shift a I can go to the search here and I could search for a hue saturation value node and I could drop this in here in between the roughness and the roughness of the 
[35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2123) Shader and this value here is going to make it lighter or darker so if I turn the value up all the way to 2 it's now going to make that texture much lighter and so now this wood floor is very rough 
[35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2132) or if I turn the value way down make it a very small number you can now see that this wood floor looks kind of wet because it is so shiny so that's a really easy way to edit the roughness 
[35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2141) just by making it lighter or darker and then as for the normal map to make it stronger or less strong you have the strength value here so you could turn the strength up but if you turn the 
[35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2152) strength way too up it might look a bit off and something might look a bit weird you can see that is like crazy bumpy or you can also turn the strength down so if I didn't want this quite as bumpy I 
[36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUZHyoeuwVI&t=2161) could turn the strength down maybe to just like a 0.1 and now you can see it is much smoother and you can of course do that for any of the other textures that you have and so this will wrap up

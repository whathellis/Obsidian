[00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=3) hey guys hitting a Morton from flip normal and in today's video we are taking a another look at alchemist this time we're actually taking a look at it we're playing around with it ourselves 
[00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=12) yeah we got a version now so we've had a little bit of time with this just to play around and figure out you know the material creation and that's where we're gonna walk you through today but first 
[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=21) off just want to mention we're currently having a TDC sale on all flip normals products they're all 25% off so make sure to head over to the marketplace and you know pick something up linked in the 
[00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=32) description so first off I just want to quickly talk about substance share this is primarily where I've been sourcing materials from is this a super great resource and it's all free so there's 
[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=44) like a thousand materials that you can just grab and then just play around with in the alchemists I would definitely recommend that you check that out okay so first off when you open alchemist 
[00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=57) you're gonna be presented with just the standard base materials we're not actually gonna be using any of those even though they are fine I created a folder here you just create folder there 
[01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=66) called substance share and then I just imported three materials that I downloaded from substance share one is like cliff Rock some sand and some moss so change the create tab and then just 
[01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=78) drag out your material so here we have a nice looking rock material that we are going to change so we're gonna we're gonna create this sand dune rock looking thing and then try to modify it so first 
[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=92) of all take your rock thing here I don't like the colors of this it doesn't really fit for what I want to do so I'm going to add a color variation filter to it and then we can start playing around 
[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=103) with the colors by default you have ten colors assigned which i think is too much so I'm gonna take it down to three so to start with I just pick random colors that are just distinct so I can 
[01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=116) see what does each color do so the first one here that's the red one that's going to be the dominant color and we're trying to make that into more Brown dark but like still warm like a warm color 
[02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=133) then we have our little purple that's like in the crevices there so maybe we want that to be that could be like a bluish color but then a little darker than that and then the green one is the 
[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=147) top one I like the idea of like a blue accent but still dark so it's not like super dominant and this is why we chose pretty extreme colors in the beginning because then was a lot easier to 
[02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=161) actually see where they were yeah yeah because if you just pick pick the colors that you want from the get-go it can be a little tricky to actually figure out what color does what okay there you go 
[02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=172) so now we have something kind of lava rock naturalistic issue oh yeah if you want to change any of this you can always go to your settings for stuff like change your output or the 
[03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=186) environment I just picked this airgun stairs because it looked nice for what I wanted to do you've got some shader adjustment here's four for the displacement quality as well as shadows 
[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=197) and tessellation that that goes on so after the color variation here I want to try and I what we talked about before anything and I was like okay maybe this is like maybe came from space so maybe 
[03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=211) it was like a media or something maybe it was a mine so there's like it's like a very iron heavy rock lucky alchemist has a rust filter so we're just apply the thrust filter in there and see what 
[03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=223) we get so this just goes like on top I think it's like kind of like a curvature blend that just goes on top of whatever you have and then you can start playing around with the spread of the raw system 
[03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=238) the color as well like if you change the age here becomes more vibrant and stuff so try to integrate it just a little bit one thing that I said that's really cool is this varnish damage scale it kind of 
[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=251) make like so like it's been flaking off all the way out here which I think it looks pretty cool and you can always increase or to priestesses like on the fly decide okay I want more or less rust 
[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=262) that's pretty nice see cool all right that's pretty cool we could just end it there now we have a rock material mm-hmm so let's get our little pallet back there 
[04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=279) you go and I just want to add the Sam now can I see what that looks like so the sand is gonna integrate so this is the first blend material that we're using so the sand is gonna integrate 
[04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=290) from the bottom and up that's just this option here you can also do from the top so the sand is the dominant one but we want to add it from look at the bottom so it's kind of like sand has been been 
[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=302) flowing in on top of this rock and then just settling here in the crevices and I assume that this here uses then the height information yeah where this yeah because it's all like live decimated 
[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=314) which is pretty cool so like for some of these materials sometimes when you blend it it can be a little tricky text to see what's going on so I'll just get rid of this and then we can adjust this 
[05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=329) sandwich here so the same material was also just from substance here so we'll just crank up some of these settings to just make this look a little more regular see and I think it's a pretty 
[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=342) cool material because we've got like this stuff that collects in between the little rip ridges and there's like small clumps of sand as well you can add some wind intensity to the 
[05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=355) sand sand clumps there go spread less control over the AO so all of these parameters are here because of this was that designer material that whoever created is a camera what his name was so 
[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=372) you know it's gonna vary based on on the material that you get and where you get it from and who's made it and what they've made available to you basically see you can always from I think for 
[06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=387) almost all for all materials you have the seat value that you can just change if you want to just mix it up a little bit which I think like sometimes you're like okay this is kind of cool it's 
[06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=396) almost there but I just want to tweak it just a tiny okay so something like that and then we'll throw on all the materials again have compute and then 
[06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=411) now we have something that's just like a tiny bit more irregular and then because this is a blend material now we can play with the height offset so this these parameters here the blend parameters are 
[07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=423) unique to whatever like material you then put on top of other materials so we can have the sand go little higher and then show through a little more but now we're running into the issue I think 
[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=437) that it's we're getting too much of the striation from from the sand so if we go and you can have an adjustment layer here so an adjustment layer just has a bunch of different generic adjustment 
[07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=453) parameters and because this is all layer base this is gonna affect whatever is below it so I just want to play around with the cliff rock here for a second so let's say the spec like say you didn't 
[07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=466) like the spec of this you can go into reflection and then just drop it all the way down or you want to make it super wet you could do that as well so this is just like a generic procedural thing 
[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=477) that Alchemist can just throw on top if you don't like how the base material looks for example so for this I think we're just gonna be playing around with a height a little bit so this value by 
[08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=491) default this value here this is a global value that's set to point two so I'll just have it there it was a little low I absolutely love that you can do this you can but you have a real time 
[08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=501) displacement like this yeah so good so yes I just want to get the sort of like down a feel of off the rocks or more they stick out a little more like before if you just take down the sharp 
[08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=516) elevation it's it's a little too smooth I'll just have them stick out a little and then yeah I think that's gonna work go back to our Santa material here and then what 
[08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=533) you can do is so I don't know if this will be good for all materials but like the blend opacity probably not force and because it's an actual opacity slider maybe maybe you have like a more 
[09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=546) desaturated look but for this we're just gonna crank it all the way up another cool thing is that for blend materials you can match the color of whatever's underneath you could have this like 
[09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=558) maybe this is like glass so cool looks like sand now yeah or like like one is like a really emotional sequence from a movie all the characters die yeah sound turns 
[09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=569) white I haven't quite figured out this talk material scale like what it seems to do is just make the material shitty it's yeah like I feel like it makes okay for the sand one here okay that totally 
[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=581) makes sense but I'll show you what I mean when we put on the the moss in a bit like it it just scales the material but it doesn't preserve the detail I think maybe that's because I can ordered 
[09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=591) like if you wanted to scale up and preserve the detail you need like higher risk map or something by default I think I'm working on a 2k Maps and maybe if she had like before it came out that 
[09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=599) would look better but yeah so you can just you know you can tweak that to your to your heart's content and a friend of mine point out that maybe this looks like a chocolate cake with like some 
[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=609) some cheese gravy or something so I mean it could be that as well you know use your imagination there so to add a little more it's called realism into this kind of 
[10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=620) sci-fi fantasy look stuff here I'm gonna find the gravel generator I love that you have this where's your gravel generator it's like the most substance like yeah thing you can think I think we 
[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=635) need another firm like substance cowboy now with your with a tablet you can only sue min until here but with your scroll wheel on the mouse you can assume it sounds a little bit like a bug that's 
[10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=650) pretty weird yeah also if you're using this on a Mac the text is gonna be super broken everywhere so maybe stick to Windows for now so just for the gravel stuff I just want 
[11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=660) to like the way I'm thinking about it so this is like windblown sand right and maybe in not the peaks here this word we have the most sand obviously but in the little ridges here that's maybe where 
[11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=672) you would have some some of these smaller stones being revealed so but not a lot because it looks stupid like that so we just have a little bit and then what we can do is just change the size 
[11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=684) of this and match it to the base material a little more just so they don't stick out as much and actually I'm just gonna make them closer to the original I love that there is a gravel 
[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=702) generator of course there is that's a really cool thing about this whole software is that you can use you can use the entire substance ecosystem for it so if there is a super cool generator made 
[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=712) in designer you can just chuck it in here yeah okay like that and then I mean there's so many different you know a parameters scattering volumes random masks and let's increase that less of 
[12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=726) them that's height and this one was really cool the height depth so you can sort of like you can embed it further into the into the sand okay so now we just have a little more variation in 
[12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=738) terms of of the sand just so it's not just regular boring sand just get a little recompute everything I found sometimes when you let it recompute again like the height yeah so exactly 
[12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=748) like this the height gets kind of messed up mmm I would assume this is a bug and it is still in beta yeah you know that it's it's it totally makes sense that you 
[12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=760) have that is not perfectly fine there are bugs here so what we can do is go in and just tweak the height of the sand I guess there you go so what are you gonna feature here I like is the contrast if 
[12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=776) you want a super sharp like you don't want anything to sort of like blend over like this would be probably a little more realistic for sand but let's pretend we're making it for a game or 
[13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=785) something then we probably want like a little bit of sand spilling over just those so it doesn't look that's hard more there you go 
[13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=799) okay so now we have some just like a small indication of some gravel or pebble there you can always increase the quantity if we want a little more variation cool and then the next thing I 
[13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=814) want to try is the cool little moss here so we'll just drag this onto the material and then we've destroyed everything so again this is just a regular Blinn material but I just want 
[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=825) to change the order a little bit so I want the moss to grow on top of the rocks as well as the rust so right now it's blending from the bottom the way that the rust works is that well I think 
[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=841) it's a curvature blend so you can change that here as well for the moss so now it's just a straight curvature blend which grows like from the top to the bottom change this from edge to cavity 
[14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=852) so now it grows in all the cavities instead which can give us a pretty cool look and then just with the balance here you can increase it so you have more or decrease it so you have less so just 
[14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=863) like just like a subtle thing where there's like some moss growing in there you can always change the curvature filter I found that if you combine the smooth and classic it just becomes a 
[14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=873) little more sharp if you wanted like super subtle but for this example we're just gonna stick with that curvature smooth but I'm really just impressed with what you can do you know just it's 
[14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=883) so quick and you can play around and modify the materials and then you're like you have a completely new material that doesn't look like your base material I am honestly so impressed by 
[14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=893) this I mean I've been I've been working as a texturized for years now and working as text writers always all those kind of in a way because you know you had to always just great images if 
[15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=902) you had sand now you you had to find an image of sand and graded properly and I had to paint Manuel masks and all this kind of things but in particularly in the city in the substance ecosystem you 
[15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=912) can you don't spend time you don't spend so much time you know doing these like manual labor tasks and you can spend more time being creative for to spend my time as a texture 
[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=924) artists on grading photos feels kind like a waste of time you want to spend me for my artistic vision yeah and some time this is just amazing also like I I played around with designer for a while 
[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=935) and got into it but like it's a really things hard core software to get into and I've forgotten everything again you know all that stuff is gone but this like alchemist took me maybe like 10 
[15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=947) minutes or so like kind of pickup just because it's very very simple and very very intuitive I like I know that people are gonna talk about mixer as well and like how the UI looks 100 percent stolen 
[16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=960) from mixer and what we're doing now is like a hundred percent stolen from mixer and yeah yeah I would agree but just from playing around with both software's is that is that plural softwares or 
[16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=972) software I think of software let's stick with that I would say that that alchemists just seems like a more powerful package I think the cool thing about mixer is 
[16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=982) that obviously you have the whole point system that's all integrated and you can just import directly from from their library and stuff but it does come with more of a price tag and they have less 
[16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=992) filters right now but maybe maybe adjust that yeah so quick quick so also had the you know we have mega scans yeah are just insanely high quality that's that's another advance but then again you have 
[16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1003) substance source where you also expand data there so I think it's just good to have these competitors so they can you know push each other and they're also both fairly early on yeah they're both 
[16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1014) invade both in beta so you know it's gonna be very interesting to see what they where do they keep them going and whenever I see a tool like alchemist I'm not judging it based on where it's 
[17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1023) currently at now I'm judging based on the potential you have and potential I'm seeing here is that it really means that you can be spend your time being creative and make awesome materials 
[17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1034) instead of all the menial tasks like I said grading photos cuz I really really hope that that age is over now and we can start having fun with texturing would be really nice I would 
[17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1045) really like that so just here to round off this material I'm gonna do the most substance thing you can do which is wander to it of course because why not okay so now our desert was flooded which 
[17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1060) is great but no survivors it's a little too flooded I just love playing around with them with the war because it's sort of it preserves everything that's underneath so like if you look at like 
[17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1072) if you look at the moss or something like right there and you play with a water level it preserves the color and preserves the sort of like illusion of it still being there honestly feels like 
[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1082) we're in a SIGGRAPH demo now when you're doing this kind of stuff this is like yeah well so this this kind of like water filter it's always one of these tools which is always five years ahead 
[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1091) yeah you can you can ever actually play with it it's always some kind of shitty demo where they're they're just doing it in this weird interface but the fact that we can actually do this is it's 
[18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1101) honestly amazing to me tiny bit something like that it needs to be nice material and then we have a flooded kind of flooded desert like asteroid material where some moss grew because maybe 
[18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1118) there's a little bit of moisture maybe it gets flooded a lot or something I don't know it rains and only these pots yeah exactly but the cool thing is that if okay let's say we want to do some 
[18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1129) variation on this if we didn't want our sand in there anymore we just disabled the sand and boom now we have I don't know like Frodo from Lord of the Rings is going through Mordor or something the 
[19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1140) good thing with this as well is when particularly dealing with rocks is it's almost impossible to determine scale if you don't have a tree or a leaf or something in it like this here could be 
[19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1149) like the Dead Marshes by itself it could be like an aerial shot or it could be really close up and it's it's almost impossible to tell compute this so like if you just were to use this you know 
[19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1163) right now it's maybe a little crazy so I think new the easiest is to just go into the displacement amplitude just a global one just bring it down a little bit or something and then you have this 
[19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1175) disgusting looking swamp here you can always make it more disgusting like make the water a little darker or maybe you want to raise the water level a little bit have it really swampy so it 
[19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1187) rained a lot Frodo would not be happy here and then change it to a sphere or something so you know then you've got a pretty cool looking material here and what you can always do is you raise the 
[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1198) water level completely and now you've destroyed your right ear that's nice yeah I feel this is one nice thing we could keep on going on forever with this yes you know just like what's doing here 
[20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1208) enabling like a like a just one water filter completely change it to look for it yeah this is one the really cool things about this enable or disable one parameter you can have completely 
[20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1218) different material yes I think I mean it's pretty pretty crazy what you can do and not a lot of time and you know we're we're definitely gonna be doing more videos like this and I want to do one 
[20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe5Ni3msvz4&list=PLBX-X8mPyxIpM3dszDoS2V5KQ_cdqGsGa&index=10&t=1229) where we also import just a bitmap where we don't use any pre-made stuff we only use the bitmaps and then we use the filters that are provided within in Alchemist so yeah if you enjoyed this

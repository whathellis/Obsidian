Description:: In this ZBrush sculpting tutorial, we cover everything you need to know in order to sculpt like a pro. The techniques covered have been developed over the last decade, ready to be used by anyone in ZBrush.

The techniques are universal when it comes to sculpting software, and it's really more about the understanding of how form works instead of software specifics, like sculpting in ZBrush. This can be done in Blender, Mudbox, MODO Sculptris, ZBrush Core and many others.

# Transcript
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=0) hey guys alan wyatt 3d here this is a short tutorial for my blender illustration shader 3.0 make sure that if you have not downloaded the most recent build of it 
[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=10) that you go over to my gumroad link down below and get the latest build of it also make sure that you have blender 3.2 or above for this specific shader so make sure that you also go over to 
[00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=21) blender.org and download the latest release build awesome so let's go ahead and jump into blender and i will tell you the shader okay so now we are in blender as you can 
[00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=39) see we are using blender 3.2 so again i just want to make sure and clarify that you are using blender 3.2 or above this shader has two different versions it has the advanced version and it has the 
[00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=51) basic version the advanced one in my opinion is obviously a lot better it comes with a few different perks the biggest thing is that it comes with the geometry node 
[01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=60) setup which i will show you here in a second the basic all it comes with is just the shader itself so the material that you are using on whatever piece you're going 
[01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=69) to be doing that will just be the basic but the advance comes with that and a few other add-ons as well painterly filter and a border kind of filter that you can use 
[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=79) on specific shaders and different things to make it where your border looks like it is on like a canvas we're going to go ahead and open the advanced here we go okay so we are in the scene 
[01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=90) this is just my default scene we'll let this compile real quick that is one thing with this shader even though it does work well it does run pretty smooth and eevee it will take 
[01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=101) a while to compile so always try to keep that in mind whenever you are making larger scenes and stuff it will take a while to load okay there we go now our shader is completely compiled into the 
[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=111) scene and as you can see it looks very painterly that is pretty much the entire goal of this shader is to make it look like it is painted 
[02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=120) now i know that it does say illustration but i wanted to kind of give more of an in-between because there are ways where you can use it to make it look like it is digitally painted other ways to make 
[02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=130) it look like it is more traditionally painted but that is all up to you and whatever you were trying to do with your specific piece so yeah let's go ahead and hop into the 
[02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=138) shader first so i'm going to go ahead and just join this down just so we can take a look at the shader a little bit better and still have a look at our apple okay 
[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=147) so we've got two main node groups now we have the before and then we have the after the reason for this is because of the vector output that i love 
[02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=157) this vector output right here is what will split up your images or your textures whatever you give it and will make it look like it is painted so let's go ahead and select our apple and we'll 
[02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=167) look at those textures to show you kind of what is going on so first off let's just open up this texture right here all this is oh actually this one let's do the second 
[02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=177) one this is just the color shader all this is is just the albedo map you guys have probably worked with this before it's just a simple color texture 
[03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=188) this is just the vector input itself that is what is doing all of this work that is why it is so important to make sure that you were using that whenever you were doing a texture so say if you 
[03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=199) were just using the uvs on their own this is what it would look like this is just the normal texture it's a bit blurred out i believe is one thing that i changed on the texture itself but as 
[03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=209) you can see is just default on its own but with the vector input from the before shader will automatically get it to where it looks a lot more painterly 
[03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=220) and i will explain all the settings that will go into that later on but for now i just want you to know that is what the vector output is doing same with this ambient occlusion map 
[03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=231) by itself it is very simple as you can see all it is is just showing some of the basic shadows in the scene but overall it is very very very basic 
[04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=241) it's just a gradient almost but with that vector input we automatically get a lot more of a painterly look on that 
[04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=251) gradient now that after node group is where a lot of things happen but mainly what it is doing is compiling all the colors and shadows and light and making it to where it looks like it 
[04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=262) is more painterly kind of overlapping them in a way that would that you would if it was pigments because it's different than just normal rgb 
[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=273) you have to think about it in more of a red blue yellow instead of a red blue green so yeah those are the two main node groups that you'll be using for this 
[04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=285) shader this last part is just an add-on this is what is doing the canvas around it more that silhouette or vignette that is going around the 
[04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=295) entire object or scene whatever you have in your specific space but for now we're just going to keep that muted on both objects 
[05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=305) okay so we're going to go ahead and show all of the settings that are on both the before and after node group so make sure that you follow along and you'll kind of see how each of 
[05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=316) them are working on their own i'll be messing with just the apple but it will work with whatever object that you have selected so yeah 
[05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=325) stroke scale pretty self-explanatory but i will say some people get this confused the higher you go up the more 
[05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=333) dense it will get so like basically the smaller the brush strokes will get the higher you go up so if we're at 50 you'll see that we have very very tiny 
[05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=343) brush strokes but if we go down to five we'll have much larger ones going down to like one will not make it where it is smaller brush strokes it 
[05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=352) will make it to where they are larger think of it more like stroke density next we have the stroke blend this is a new setting on the 3.0 that 
[06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=363) pretty much blends some of the strokes together so as you can see we've kind of got more harder edges i'm going to go ahead and put this down to 25. yeah there we go 
[06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=372) and we've got all of our hard edges going on around each of the strokes but if you add in a bit of that blend it kind of just blends them together don't overkill it 
[06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=380) because it will start looking almost noisy and grainy if you start going too high as you can see like right there that's too much you're kind of losing the entire effect 
[06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=390) in the first place so it's not really worth going higher than 10 normally i like to keep it at about five i think that's a good mix but that is up to you and whatever you were 
[06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=400) doing next up we have scale variation this is something that was on the previous shader all it does is add variation to each of the scales that are in your 
[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=408) specific object as you can see it is kind of just adding in a bit of a difference in between what is the larger scales and smaller scales and 
[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=418) you can kind of add in and subtract however much you want i normally keep it at zero but you can do whatever you want with that invert contrast we're going to go ahead 
[07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=427) and just hide our blanket in the background just so we're only seeing our main apple right now and the invert contrast is pretty self-explanatory but it is a little 
[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=438) confusing for some people basically what it is doing is is taking the diffuse texture that is coming in over here the diffuse shader sorry and it is splitting that up and then 
[07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=449) giving it contrast so if you want your edges to be sharper you will add more contrast if you want it to be inverted and you want the light to be the shadow and the shadow to be light then you can 
[07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=459) also flip it so i'll show you here right now as you can see the further you go down the more contrast you're going to get with it and if you go 
[07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=468) all the way over past zero you will invert it make sure though that if you do want soft shadows pretty much across your objects you 
[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=477) still need to make sure that you are working with large radius lights and then also make sure that you are not using like a glossy shader you're using 
[08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=486) something more like diffuse or principle bsdf whatever you think is best for your specific use case next up we have our random seed pretty easy to use a lot of times what 
[08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=498) i'm importing is the frame index so if you want you can just do the frame and it will automatically go with the frame it will just randomize where the strokes are that's all it's doing 
[08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=511) very very simple you don't have to use this though i like to use it for animation but you don't have to if you want all the strokes to stay in the exact same spot they will especially 
[08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=520) with the uv input they will always stay in the exact same location just like any other texture that you're going to use on your scene and you can just change it around find 
[08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=528) the one that you want to use and stick with it yeah next up we have our shader after this is what is compiling everything together the colors the textures the light and shadow colors 
[09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=541) or values and then kind of splitting it apart also in this case we are standing over our stroke and color data from the before 
[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=553) node and sending it over to the afternoon make sure that you are using these two if you are not it's not going to work at all you always want to make sure that you have these 
[09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=562) two outputs from the before shader going into the after shader this is a lot of information it's mainly the light information but also kind of that vector stroke information that we 
[09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=573) have coming out of the textures itself so yes make sure that you are using them so we're going to go ahead and jump over here as you can see we have our texture and color all this 
[09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=584) is doing is splitting between the texture input whatever we have inputted up here and the color input 
[09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=593) these two colors right here right now it's like an orange and a purple those are our color inputs and then our texture input is coming from whatever 
[10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=601) texture we are using now we can slide back and forth between the two and you can see how it's going from the orange to more of that red that red is what is coming from this original 
[10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=613) texture now do keep in mind that the texture colors that are coming from this are still going to match the saturation 
[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=623) and the value of the color inputs the reason i did this is so that if you are using a specific texture that has 
[10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=633) darker values on it darker shadow and you are trying to match up a specific shadow element from say this specific object right here this apple we can see that it has a shadow 
[10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=645) side we want that value to always match the other shadows in our scene now in normal rendering that's automatically done for us but in this 
[10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=655) case we are outputting an emission shader in the end so we have to kind of manually set each of our shadow and light values in our scene so if you see right here i'm going to go 
[11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=665) ahead and raise up the shadow value now notice we're all the way over in texture so we are not using any of the color information except for the value and the saturation 
[11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=676) so if we lower this down all the way to black our shadows become completely black if we have it a little bit higher our shadows become more of a charcoal 
[11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=686) gray and we can keep in some of that color as well but what it's mainly using is like i said the saturation notice if i go over 
[11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=695) to green it's not going to change it much so depending on where your saturation is it will use whatever that is that is just used for matching up 
[11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=705) there are ways to completely turn this off and i probably will have it as a setting later on in a future update but it is very nice once you understand how 
[11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=715) it works so keep that in mind normally when you first open up the after shader so i'll add in a new one group 
[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=723) after you'll see that is great make sure you add saturation into those or else your texture input will have no 
[12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=732) saturation at all it will just be gray also keep in mind that if you are using the texture and color slider right here you can use it almost as color grading on top of specific objects so if you 
[12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=743) want all of your objects to have almost a color graded feeling where they're unified you can add in this texture color to about 0.5 
[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=753) and kind of have them all unified especially with the shadow color i will say if your shadow colors are all the same on every single object and you have just a bit of that color gradient it 
[12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=763) looks so good and it really unifies the overall piece next thing up is edge transparency i'm going to go ahead and turn off our geometry nodes for now just to work with our edge transparency 
[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=774) and show you how it works okay all it does is it adds a bit of a transparent edge around your entire piece this is great for breaking up edges this comes with the basic shader 
[13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=786) already on its own and it can overall break up your edges pretty well i like to use the geometry notes to take it a step further than what we have right here but 
[13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=796) overall it will get the job done normally especially for objects that are very far away in your scene i would not even use the geometry noise it's going to take a while to compute and it's not 
[13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=806) even worth it keep in mind that it is using the fresnel input to kind of create these specific edges so rounded objects and more organic 
[13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=815) objects work a lot better but with sharper edges so like say with cubes boxes that type of thing you will probably want to use the geometry nodes to split up the edges 
[13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=825) because fresno will not give much uh you can also bevel your edges which will make it a little bit better but still not always perfect i like to keep this at around point six point four somewhere 
[13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=835) around there depending on your object but yeah let's go ahead and add back in our geometry nodes and we are going to look at our other settings 
[14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=844) like i said already we have our light and shadow side in the future i would love to have highlights light shadow and ambient shadow or occlusion shadow at the bottom i'd like to have 
[14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=856) four different values i'll go into this that's going to get very complicated but it will give you more freedom over the specific objects that you're working 
[14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=864) with and what you want them to look like over here at the bottom we have our value and hue variation these two they're not super important but i love using them if i increase that 
[14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=874) all the way to one we get some darker and lighter strokes across our entire object same with hue if we increase that we will get some 
[14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=884) more pink and more yellow strokes across our entire object since in this case we are working with orange we are kind of going in both directions with the hue and kind of getting a 
[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=896) lighter and about darker but then also a more reddish pink and a more yellowish one don't overkill it don't use this all the way up or else you will start uh kind of 
[15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=907) losing the original colors that you have underneath there because through this object there's not very many oranges now but our main object is orange so we want to make sure that we 
[15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=917) don't use it too far i like to keep both of them at about 0.4 [Music] that is up to you and whatever you are 
[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=924) creating okay and last up we have our color palette now this is a new feature that only comes with the advanced shader you can also buy it separate it's a great 
[15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=934) filter node i'll go ahead and actually show you the filter node itself let's go ahead and bring that in here [Music] here we go painters color filter 
[15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=944) what this does is it basically will take the color palette or the color input that you already have in your entire scene so in this case we have let's go ahead and open up our 
[15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=957) fabric again and we have our apple which is like orange and purple and red and then our fabric which is more blue and purple so we have four main colors 
[16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=969) throughout this entire scene now what it's going to do is it's going to make that into a color spectrum and it will basically limit that color spectrum depending on specific color palettes 
[16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=979) that i've included i have nine different color palettes that it can use it's going to use the same colors in your scene so don't think that this is going to do all the color 
[16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=989) work for you you still want to add in your basic colors what it will do is kind of change it up along the way i'm going to go ahead and connect this actually i think it already is 
[16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=999) yes okay so as you can see all it does is just change the overall colors that are being used in it for point one this is actually a vincent van gogh 
[16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1010) color filter as you probably know most of his paintings were very blue and yellow that was just two of his favorite colors that he liked to use also teal 
[16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1018) and as you can see it made it into those specific colors it took its closest color neighbor so in this case orange turned into more of a yellow 
[17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1029) and the blue turned into more of a teal in the future i wanted to release more versions of it more luts to use on top of each of these but for now there are nine different 
[17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1039) ones zero just know it'll have your original colors but if you change it to any of these you can kind of just look around 
[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1046) and kind of see what you like if you want to connect multiple objects into all doing it at the exact same time like i have in this case all you have to do is 
[17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1055) let's go ahead and delete this we're going to go to our specific object that we want to use as our default or our base object in this case the apple we're going to go 
[17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1065) down to color palette right click it and we are going to say copy as new driver and then we can go into our other objects in this case i just have the 
[17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1075) fabric but if you have 10 other objects in your scene that you want the color filter to work with you can go over here and then just paste driver and they will always be connected now 
[18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1086) which is super helpful especially for larger scenes where you don't want to have to do it for every individual material take a look at this it only takes in one color 
[18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1096) which is really cool so you can use whatever color you want so let's just bring in rgb let's pick an orange color and let's go ahead and go over it so 
[18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1107) yeah this is just with no color palette but then we can go through each of them and you will see how it slowly changes they're still all orange ish 
[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1117) some of them are a bit more peach some are a bit more red some are a bit more yellow and that is all dependent on the filter on them if you go into 
[18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1126) the specific file that i have included with the advanced shader that will explain this a bit more it will show what each of the specific color palettes all they're all from famous artists 
[18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1136) through time vincent van gogh andrew zorn leonardo da vinci there's a ton of different ones so definitely experiment with that it's a lot of fun i'm going to 
[19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1145) go ahead and explain what is going on over here before we move on overall all it is doing is taking the edited attributes from our geometry nodes whenever you are using 
[19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1157) the advanced shader and you have the attributes imported so in this case we have our geometry nodes right here and we are 
[19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1168) using these specific attributes we are using our uv maps and our normal if you are just using the basic shader you will not need this but if you are using the geometry nodes you 
[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1180) will definitely need this all it is doing is taking the attributes that we have messed with we have changed and inputting them back into our object let me go ahead and show you what i mean 
[19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1192) let's add a texture coordinate node and we're going to just use our uv first off as you can see it's already broken if you try to use the texture coordinate node while using geometry nodes 
[20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1204) and the specific uv map that you have it will come out as black it will not work so you have to use the uv map right here i should go and show you this without the geometry nodes enabled you 
[20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1216) can use it so on the basic shader perfectly fine you can definitely use the uv texture coordinate but whenever you add on 
[20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1225) these outgoing strokes so if you look at it in object mode you can see what this geometry node is doing is basically creating an outline or a 
[20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1235) line art modifier on top of your specific objects and then it is going to spread strokes all across those lines in this case they're turning into curves and then you are distributing points 
[20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1246) along those curves we want wherever these specific strokes are the uvs to be the exact same so what we're having to do is transfer our uvs from the object over to the strokes and that is why now 
[21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1260) it has basically become an attribute to use them you will have to use the uv input or an attribute with the uv map name on it at the moment i only have it working with uv maps that are called 
[21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1274) uv map this is like the default name that comes with all objects in blender but if you import a specific object that has a different like character uv map if it is called that 
[21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1286) rename it it will not work at the moment i want to make it in the future where that will change but at the moment it is not always make sure that your uv maps are named uv underscore map or just uv 
[21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1298) map whatever is the specific case for blender that you were using at that time so yes now we're going to look at our normal let's go to our normal 
[21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1308) and you will see automatically that these strokes are all facing towards us they have the same color as the apple does right in this location which is facing towards us or facing towards the 
[22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1322) camera we want our strokes to have the exact same normal color as what part of the object that they are connecting to the reason for this is because we want the shading to come through with it as 
[22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1334) you can see with just the texture coordinate nodes our normal is not matching up with whatever is on our specific object but if we use the specific attribute and the vector 
[22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1344) transform node it will match it up perfectly what this is doing is it is taking the information what direction it thinks that it is facing and making it match up with whatever object that the 
[22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1355) strokes are on now our normal attribute through the vector transform into our diffuse node we now have our shadow in our light 
[22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1365) happening just from the object itself and not the individual strokes i'll show you again what happens if you just use the texture node input look at this they're all being lit even 
[22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1374) on the shadow side we don't want that we want them to be the exact same value so make sure that if you are using the advanced shader and you're using the geometry nodes that you use the 
[23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1386) attribute normal also it doesn't always work with every single type of shader that you have on your scene so say if you're using a glossy shader reflection shader the sdf it may not work the exact 
[23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1398) same diffuse vsdf is probably the best it does it very well but it's not going to be a very shiny object so if you want more glossy you can add a glossy shader but 
[23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1409) the normals might not work the exact same mainly because things are reflective reflective planes add in a whole different level of complexity so 
[23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1419) just keep that in mind if you're ever going to use this so yeah there we go we have or i just wanted to explain kind of where these are coming from 
[23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1429) when you are using the basic shader like i said so no geometry nodes make sure that you don't have any normal input from this at all if you have this still going into it it's going to get 
[24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1442) confused because now without the geometry nodes nothing is showing up at all that's why you want to make sure that you are just using the diffuse bsdf on its own just 
[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1452) like normal uv map will still work just the same since we are using the uv map mode you don't have to worry about it there but just keep in mind that if you are going to use uvs make sure that you 
[24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1462) are using the uv map node instead of the texture coordinate mode i'm going to go ahead and hop into how the geometry nodes works now we don't even have to open it but i'm going to go ahead and 
[24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1473) open our geometry nodes editor and take a look at everything that's going on we have five main groups kind of going on in this specific node tree the first off is 
[24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1484) just our stroke offset this is what is making it to where our offset of the specific strokes on the edges are either inside or outside of our object as you can see now at the moment most of these 
[24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1496) are currently set as integers this can be changed you can change this if you want manually i plan on changing it in an update this was a mistake but i don't want to add in any update until i have 
[25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1506) specific things changed be on the lookout for that but for now it's very easy to change the offset to just a float instead of an integer so that is just the stroke offset then we have our 
[25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1516) line art down here this is where all the magic is happening what this is doing is taking the camera information in your scene and it is pretty much making silhouette around each object whenever 
[25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1528) you are using this make sure you have your camera inputted if you do not you'll notice nothing comes up it is very very very vital that you have a camera input so that it knows what it is 
[25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1538) looking at and it is going through a lot of different things but basically what it is doing is creating i'll show you here real quick output so as you can see now we have 
[25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1547) kind of line art of our specific object it is very simple but it is only from the specific view of the camera this is very very similar to the grease 
[25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1559) pencil line art modifier if you've ever used that before this is what is distributing all of our points on it so next up we have our distribute points information going connect this back up 
[26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1570) real quick so our point distribution is being done in two different ways first off we have our borders or our line art like i have right here already and then we have our normals this is just 
[26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1581) distributing it across the object and making it just like you would with a normal point distribution if this is all you want you can just turn it on to normals but if you want the specific 
[26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1591) line art which is a lot more optimized i will say even though it does not require as many nodes it's not distributing as many points in the long run i think that it works a lot better for larger scenes 
[26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1601) and specific objects but if for any reason you want just have the normal point distribution you can use that as well one other thing that is doing is taking the distance that the 
[26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1611) camera is away from the object and it is making the stroke scale that size so if for some reason you have very large objects make sure that your camera is also at a relative distance from that or 
[27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1624) else the stroke scale will act a little weird but let me go ahead and show you what i mean if i just zoom out a little bit you'll notice that the strokes automatically are getting larger but 
[27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1633) what they're doing actually is just staying the exact same size as they were from the camera so if this is what your scene is looking like just zoom in your camera a little bit and it will fix most 
[27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1644) of the issues you can also change the stroke scale through the geometry node settings right here on the right side if you want to just make them a little bit smaller or a 
[27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1652) bit bigger go ahead that is all up to you you also have power over the density of how many strokes are being spread across your object if you only want a few you 
[27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1662) can definitely go with that or if you want to fill it up just make sure that you do not go above 10. this gets busy very very very fast if you go into 11 or 12 even 
[27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1671) it will probably crash blender so keep it at a relative number below 10. so yeah stroke offset we already showed you that all it's doing is just changing how far the objects are inside 
[28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1684) or outside of your object five is in the middle it is right there on the edge but if you go any further out it will extend it out and if you go any 
[28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1695) further in it will go inside random seed is just the same as the random seed in the shader itself all it's doing is changing what strokes are being distributed on the point in 
[28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1706) the object mode it doesn't look like it is changing very much it's shaking a little bit but overall it's pretty much the same what it's basically doing is changing 
[28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1715) which texture input is coming into it so keep that in mind if you are going to use the random seed on the shader also make sure that you're doing it on the geometry notes or else it'll look weird 
[28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1727) when like specific strokes on the shader change but they don't change on the object itself last we have our excluded vertex group and our camera information our excluded vertex group is just going 
[28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1739) to exclude specific areas that are on our object if you do not want strokes in a specific area just put them onto a vertex group and then import that vertex group right here all that is doing is 
[29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1750) just excluding it say if we select this area right here we don't want any strokes on that side of the object we apply them to a group this right here it automatically comes 
[29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1761) in as group so that's just what i have it set as but whatever your specific vertex group name is just make sure that you have that selected underneath the excluded 
[29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1770) vertex group for this apple the place that i tend to exclude is actually the top of the stem as you can see there is a stroke that is going kind of in the wrong direction the reason is because of 
[29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1782) the geometry itself we have just our objects selected right here just in the top in edit mode all i want to do is just exclude these specific points so i'm just going to assign them 
[29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1793) to that and then add in our group now we no longer have that random stroke going the wrong direction camera resolution is also very important the main reason is because we are also using camera culling 
[30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1803) which is happening up here in this specific area all that's going on is basically whatever is outside of the camera range no particles will be distributed there 
[30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1812) way better for large scenes you don't have to worry about it killing your entire system whenever you turn on the strokes definitely make sure that you have all the correct information in here 
[30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1822) for your camera if you are using a larger camera or if you're going more portrait mode whatever you are doing for your specific camera settings just make sure that you 
[30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1832) also set them right so yeah perfect and then last we have our attributes this is where all the information that i was just telling you about with the 
[30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1841) normal and the uv map information is happening this is very very very vital so make sure that it is always set and make sure that if you are using these right here that you are also using these 
[30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1853) two okay so now we are just in a very basic scene in blender all it is is just a sphere a ground plane a light source and a camera very very 
[31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1862) very simple but i want to show you how to basically bring in the specific shader into this specific scene so the easiest way to do that is by appending 
[31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1873) now most people will probably think that the best thing to do is to append our specific node groups but in this case i think it is a lot better to just depend on the specific material itself 
[31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1884) in this case we're just going to append fabric texture that we had on the other one so let's go ahead and go into make sure that you have your specific advance our basic shader selected and then go 
[31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1895) into our materials and we are going to do our fabric eevee so as you can see we're just going to select that material and we are going to append it 
[31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1905) nothing is going to change obviously at the beginning but the main thing that we want is we want our material to now show up under here it should automatically come in and there we go we're going to 
[31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1915) go ahead and go into our shader editor we're going to go ahead and start changing things up here this is the same exact material that we had before now you're probably asking why do we have 
[32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1924) these weird dark shadows that is coming from this base ambient occlusion map right here we're gonna go ahead and just delete that for now so let's go ahead and go into render mode 
[32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1934) and yeah this should be working pretty much properly the only issue right now is since we do not have our geometry nodes our normal input is not correct so we're just going 
[32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1942) to unplug that for now and give it a second to compile cool so there it is now we have our basic illustration shader inside our scene now 
[32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1956) go ahead and delete that as well i'm gonna go ahead and hide our paint borders and just work with what we've got here one thing i always love to do in the 
[32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1967) specific scenes when i'm working with this shader is to add an ambient occlusion map it is not necessary for the shader to work but i think it really pulls out the specific shadows in your 
[32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1978) scenes and unifies it a lot more to make your objects feel like they are grounded with the scene if you are going to do an ambient occlusion map make sure you do it before you add your geometry nodes on 
[33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1989) top of it there's just a glitch right now whenever you have geometry nodes basically your objects are becoming instances they're no longer actual objects in your scene 
[33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=1997) so what is happening is that you cannot bake any specific textures but we're going to go ahead and do that real quick we're going to go ahead and bake our ambient occlusion while we have 
[33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2006) just our object and none of the geometry those settings let's go ahead and just add an amino inclusion map very simple but we're going to go into cycles cycles is required for baking so just keep that 
[33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2017) in mind let's go ahead and keep our objects open but we are going to go ahead and add in the exact same material into our ground plane as well and what this is doing now is just taking our 
[33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2028) ambient occlusion and that is all that is displaying at this point but what we want to do is bake this to a texture first off i'm going to increase it to probably about three just to add a bit 
[33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2038) more just to kind of give a bit more of that gradient then we're going to add in an image texture we're going to create our own so in this case it's going to be sphere sphere 
[34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2048) or ambient occlusion that's what i like to call we're going to have our specific object make sure that you have this texture selected whenever you are baking the textures we're going to have that 
[34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2057) there and then we are going to go down to bank and do a mission i know that is weird because there's actually an aim and occlusion right there but i like to use 
[34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2066) the emission mainly because we are using the ambient occlusion node right now and whenever it is outputting just a color output it is actually outputting as a mission this is for any use case 
[34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2077) whenever you only have a specific mission output definitely bacon emission because it'll be a lot faster and it looks way better in the end we'll go ahead and bake this 
[34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2085) real quick make sure that you have your texture selected and your object selected and then we're just going to press bake and there we go oh yes i am using a cube 
[34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2094) that is subdivided so let's go ahead and fix our uvs up a little bit better let's just split it down the middle unwrap take a look at them there we go yeah very simple gonna go and bake that again 
[35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2105) baking what if you're using a mission is way way faster than any other mode that i've ever used definitely try to use that if you can now we have our basic texture one thing to keep in 
[35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2115) mind whenever you are doing textures like this is you will have seams right now we have a seam going through the middle and these two areas right here where the 
[35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2123) seam is very very close to each other could add some issues maybe when you are unwrapping make sure that you add a little bit of margin in between each of your objects let's just do 0.05 
[35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2134) that will probably make it a lot better for our seams it will just prevent it from adding too much from one side to the other because we are messing with the vector and that vector is going to 
[35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2144) partially overlap with the seams if they're too close to each other so make sure you just have a little bit of a margin that's just something to keep in mind we're gonna go ahead and bake that 
[35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2151) again one more time there we go okay so now we have our baked texture this is a perfect texture i think it'll work fine we are going to go ahead and pack that into our scene 
[36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2163) all that does is just keep the information on there so that it doesn't end up getting wiped out later on when you like save the file or close it and open it with just the texture itself it 
[36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2172) is automatically going to the sphere but our ground is now also using the same material we want to change that up so let's go ahead and just duplicate material 
[36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2181) we're going to delete that texture create a new one let's do ground plane ground plane ao we're going to input our ambient occlusion again and we are just going to do the same exact thing this 
[36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2194) should already be separated pretty well because there are no uv seams on the ground so you don't have to worry about it here we're going to go ahead and bake that and there we go yeah now we have 
[36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2202) our ground plane ambient occlusion let's go ahead and also pack that right down there and now we can delete our ambient occlusion so now do you see this look at that already some basic lighting even 
[36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2212) though it is not always necessary i think that ambient occlusion adds in so much to any scene that you are using something to always remember is ambient occlusion is not affected by the lights 
[37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2222) in your scene basically the way that it is working is ambient occlusion is small areas that are in between specific objects that is where they come from in the first place it is always the 
[37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2231) crevices or how objects are interacting with other objects or how areas are overlapping with each other so for a specific character ambient inclusion could be awesome definitely try to use 
[37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2241) it but keep in mind though if you are going to have your object where is not on the ground all the time or if it's like rotating or something you cannot bake your texture and expect it to work 
[37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2250) as you see right here if we rotate our object now this is no longer a set to the plane just like before so you're going to have to bake out like your entire image sequence 
[37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2260) if you have to and there are specific add-ons that can help you with that for this case we're just doing more of a still life so we don't have to worry about that too much now we can use this 
[37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2269) with the vector output from our before and you can see that we already have some brush strokes of that ambient occlusion yeah there we go both objects let's go ahead and go back into ev and 
[38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2280) we are also going to add in a color ramp a lot of times when it is being converted over it feels like you don't have enough shadow almost from the ambient occlusion so sometimes it's good 
[38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2289) to just add in a color ramp and pull up that shadow side just a bit we can also put it on ease and it will give us a bit more information i have to keep that at about point one two five 
[38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2302) something like that do the exact same here let's just copy it over there we go now we just have kind of our ground ambient occlusion with our specific 
[38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2311) objects we're going to go ahead and plug that into our texture input on both objects make sure that you do that now let's go and take a look at the shader and what we get i will go and change the 
[38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2322) object colors as well from this blue from the sphere it's more of an orange but let's keep the shadow pretty much the same as you can see our shadow ambient occlusion map is also being 
[38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2332) affected right here if we take our specific shader and then move it up you can see that it is still there sometimes it is a bit hit depending on your shadows this is one of the things i want 
[39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2341) to change in the future to where maybe our cast shadow is not quite as dark as our amy occlusion shadow so that's stuff i'll change in the future but for now you can see it's still there yeah 
[39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2353) but all that does is just make it feel like it is grounded with your scene if we take it out of both especially out of the ground plane you'll notice that now it just does not feel like it's 
[39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2364) connecting the same way as it does when we have this input it just adds another level onto it that i really like very simple to use not too complicated and you already have your shader all 
[39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2373) inputted which is great we're going to go ahead and add a bit of edge transparency to our sphere with our plane that will not work and because of the plane itself it is flat 
[39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2384) and the fresnel is not affecting any edges specifically so that's why it's good to use the geometry nodes for that case let's change this to a bit more orange 
[39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2392) yeah there we go i love that we can change our stroke scale go down a little bit make them a little bit bigger there we go okay cool now we are going to 
[40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2401) add in our geometry notes we're going to do it the exact same way but instead of adding our material we are going to add in our node group so if you go into node 
[40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2412) trees and then go to paint strokes that is our specific geometry notes whenever you are trying to append the specific node group you don't need all these other ones all 
[40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2421) you need is paint strokes specifically sometimes it will append in a specific say the camera or something but in this case it did not which is good let's go ahead and add in our geometry nodes and 
[40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2432) paint strokes obviously right when you see it nothing changes we need our camera information so you're going to go ahead and add in that camera that you have coming from right there there we go 
[40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2442) now we have our paint strokes going around our object if we wanted to change up the scale and stuff we can to whatever we're looking for our density as well 
[40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2450) and we're going to go ahead and add it to our vaccine as well strokes and our camera there we go uh notice how they are a lot bigger on here mainly because of the scale of the object 
[41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2462) whenever you are working with the shader make sure that you apply the scale of all the objects in your scene and it will make the strokes all the same scale as well like i said with how it is using 
[41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2472) the camera distance as it is making the stroke scale it will work with the camera distance to figure out how large they should be so if these two numbers in this case six 
[41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2482) let's have them both the same they should be the exact same scale on both even though the object itself is larger these strokes back here are larger than these but in the camera view 
[41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2492) specifically because of the perspective of the scene they look like they are the same so that is very helpful in specific use cases for larger scenes so always keep that in mind that you want to apply 
[41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2501) the transformation specifically the scale so yeah now we're going to go ahead and make sure that we have our vector input also in there just to fix up any colors that were a little bit off 
[41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2511) right there from the shading and do that again right here ground plane and there you go that is how you import the shader from one object to another so yeah that is 
[41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2519) our blender illustration shader 3.0 there's a lot of changes to it but i think it is much easier to use and also a lot more intuitive whatever scenes and objects that you have going on it is way 
[42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2530) better in my opinion so definitely have a look at it update if you have a chance if you have watched all the way to the end thank you so much i also want to thank all of my current customers that 
[42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2539) have bought the shader it helps me tremendously way more than you think also thank you to all of the people who helped me along the way with the shader i am not a coder but i had a lot of help 
[42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2549) from specific people who had much more experience in geometry notes than i did so definitely thank you to all of them especially arendelle and his discord i'll also link that down below if you 
[42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB8CQTCqym0&t=171s&t=2559) ever want to catch me or some of the other guys in there if you want to learn geometry nodes that is definitely the place to go thank you so much for watching and i will see you next time

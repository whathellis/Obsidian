(Description:: In this video I go through the full process creating an emergency control panel using Autodesk Maya and Adobe Substance 3D Painter. I wanted to change it up this week and make a slower-paced video where I cover my 3D modeling, UV mapping, and texturing workflow. The reference I used was based off of two images, a concept by Ali Raham, and another one by an unknown artist.)

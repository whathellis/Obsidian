(Description:: Hi everyone, let's bake and texture our Flashbang! This is the Marmoset Toolbag 4 part of the tutorial where you will learn how to import our previously created flashbang low and highpoly models to bake our input maps such as normal, AO, curvature as well as Color ID mask.) ðŸ‘Œ
We will then setup a texture scene and create triple A quality textures for our grenade and conveniently since Marmoset is a real time render software also make renders at the end. You can download the one month free trial version on the Marmoset website. 

A lot of effort goes into the creation of these tutorials nonmatter if they are paid or like this one free on YouTube. If you want to support my work then you can buy this tutorial as a bundle together with the previous one to keep the ChamferZone YouTube channel going with high quality content. In return you get the videos in downloadable format in the best available quality for offline watching. 4 hours and 30 minutes of Blender beginner tutorial content. Your support is much appreciated! ðŸ™‚ https://chamferzone.gumroad.com/l/BlenderForBeginnersTipJarEdition

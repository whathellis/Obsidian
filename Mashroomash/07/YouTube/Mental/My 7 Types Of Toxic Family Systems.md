[00:00](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=0) If you grew up in trauma and dysfunction,   you probably don't realize that the 
type of toxic family that you grew up in   is more common than you think. I'll go further 
that the types of issues that you struggle with   as an adult, is predictable from the type 
of family structures that you grow up in. So I'm going to cover in this video, what I think 
are seven highly common toxic family systems   
[00:24](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=24) and I'm also going to add about 
what kinds of issues might need   to be processed with each type of system. I'm Patrick. I'm a childhood trauma therapist, 
I'm primarily a group therapist and I usually   have all my group clients complete something 
called the genogram which is their family   tree of dysfunction - three generations of 
alcoholism, depression, personality disorders,   
[00:45](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=45) um sort of cultural stuff, historical stuff, 
and what we're looking for is to have a clearer   picture of the person's story through doing 
this visual sort of exercise. I've been in   private practice for about 10 years now and I was 
thinking I've probably heard about 500 stories,   500 cases where the person is presenting their 
genogram to me into the group and through those   500, this is where this list of seven, where 
I was thinking about seeing the patterns and   
[01:15](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=75) I came up with these seven, sort of families 
that I see in my own practice. This is not   a rigorous research study, this is not empirical 
data, it's just sort of what I see in my practice. I'm thinking that childhood trauma, what I'm 
learning, is so much more patternized and   predictable and I think that that's why you guys 
are maybe, like, resonating with these videos   because this is the stuff that is sort of my 
clients stories are teaching me about these   
[01:41](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=101) patterns. So, as you're watching, you can identify 
with one specific of these seven. You might say,   &quot;Oh my God, that's my family to a t&quot; but 
most likely you're going to identify with   several of these and there'll be 
overlap or combinations of these. If you're new to me or you're new to the channel, 
welcome! Hit some buttons if you like these   videos. You can't miss with any of the buttons 
on your screen. If these videos are helpful to   
[02:05](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=125) you and your recovery, you can support the work 
that goes into this channel over at my Patreon   account and if you want to connect with me and 
join a waiting list or look at some course work,   you can check out my website and I'll have all 
the links in the description below this video. So, here we go. I do want to say that this 
list can be triggering and I don't mean to   name things in such a casual way as you hear 
me talk. It's just sort of I'm so sort of used   
[02:28](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=148) to this work that's where that is sort of coming 
from. But I don't mean to be sort of insensitive,   but as a heads up we're going to get into some 
pretty heavy duty stuff. Stick around to the   end of the video about how to make this into a 
resource. I'm going to have some instructions   about how you can use this list and your 
own sort of healing in your own journey. Number seven: first one is looks good on paper.
 
Incidentally these are just random numbers, it's   
[02:58](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=178) not leveled in severity or anything like that. So 
you may have heard that term before - looks good   on paper. This family's major focus is controlling 
image and avoiding feelings at all cost. Feelings   like of shame, problems with the kids, problems 
in the marriage. This family does not do feelings.   In fact, I think more energy goes into covering up 
feelings, than the energy that it would actually   simply take to address them. Some traits and 
examples: Inauthenticity that other people in   
[03:28](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=208) the community don't pick up on. Meaning that 
the family is seen as like super, super legit,   super has it together. People don't notice the 
dysfunction underneath. A family like this can   be meticulous about the yard but they will cover 
things up like a really unhappy marriage. There's   a lot of energy that goes into covering up messy 
things in the family like teenagers acting out   no one talks about the drunk uncle or the affair 
so there's lots of sort of secrets, lots of sort   
[03:55](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=235) of pretending or putting things away. Values. This 
is big. Values are usually heavily rooted in one   station in life - going to the right school, 
becoming a doctor, looking perfect dress-wise,   image and status. There can also be a vibe of 
like looking down upon you know mediocre sort   of professions, um mediocre schools, artists, you 
know looking down upon the secular, looking down   upon the non-secular, just doesn't matter. This 
tends to be from an affluent sort of like sort   
[04:30](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=270) of dynamic and affluent family but it doesn't 
mean that it can't come from lower economic   statuses and sort of like all types of families 
can be looking trying to look good on paper.   This family also sort of perceives having 
problems as weakness which is a big one. I   often think about the the parents of this family. 
They want to be seen as like contributing members   of society or they want to seem like good church 
people but their inner life can be a disaster.   
[04:58](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=298) This kind of system is really confusing and 
oppressive from the place of pressure on kids   to perform and to look certain ways and no 
one does feelings and it's pretty rigid.   Kids in these families really struggle with 
their own identity and maybe spontaneity.   They can also struggle later in life with 
authenticity and being true to themselves.   Kids, like I think about teenagers growing up in 
this or late teenagers, is like if they don't get   
[05:27](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=327) into the right school they can become suicidal, 
if they make mistakes, they can get into a major   depression where the stakes are so high in a 
family like this which is pretty bad. Adults who   grow up coming from a family system like this 
may potentially struggle with perfectionism,   authenticity, like I mentioned, disappointing 
others, a bit of emptiness in a way that they   may think that becoming top tier doctor is 
going to make them sort of happy but there's   
[05:52](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=352) a chasing of things, comparing themselves to 
others and maybe not knowing how to have fun.   The thing to maybe process in your recovery 
if you grew up in a family system like this   is how things were so conditional and how 
the adults were totally focused on the   wrong things - that's one piece in therapy 
that I'm probably going to be discussing   with a client who grew up in a family 
system like that. So that's number seven. 
[06:18](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=378) Number six is what I call ships in the night. This 
is really a family that is centered upon neglect   and disconnection when it comes to connecting 
as a couple and then connecting as a family.   Incidentally through these examples guys, 
I'm just giving heterosexual examples,   it can be applicable to anything of 
being applicable to same-sex marriages,   try not to look at these from such a concrete 
lens. I'm open to whatever your experience was. 
[06:45](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=405) So ships in the night. Here are some examples... 
Kids go to boarding school or they stay with other   family and there's not connection. The parents 
seem to be living separate lives as if they were   playing house still, parents are more engaged in 
work, their own friendships outside of the family   or have secret lives rather than be invested 
in their own marriage and their own children.   Children might be raised by grandparents, they may 
get more parenting from their friends parents and   
[07:14](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=434) there's a deep sadness to this system because it's 
like no one knows how to connect. Children can   feel that the parents are actual strangers. That 
much lack of connection or they have a vibe like   that, I also think about maybe like one parent 
is working six months out of the year and then   that parent becomes sort of a stranger to the 
children. In adulthood, for those coming from   a family system like this, they're most likely 
going to struggle with intimacy on several levels.   
[07:42](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=462) Also, someone coming from this family system will 
also probably struggle with feeling like they're   always on the outside of things, um, and later 
when if they get married or have friendships, they   may see their partner or their partner's family 
interact from a place of intimacy and it's like   super foreign them. Lastly, being neglected is 
very familiar to someone who comes from a family   system like this and they might have a really low 
bar about what to expect from others. The thing   
[08:11](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=491) to process with coming from a family system like 
this in your own healing journey or in therapy or   whatever, is to hold the parents accountable for 
being so checked out and that they were just going   through the motions of of kind of having a family 
without actually cultivating having a family.   There's a big difference between those two things. 
I think about it like a non-child-centered house. So moving on, so that was that. 
[08:36](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=516) Number five is what I call, this one's 
big, it's what i call the anti-love family.   This one's hard. As messed up as my own 
childhood was, my mother was able to be loving   and affectionate when we were small when she was 
sober or when she was home. She expressed love and   was affectionate but she actually didn't have 
the behavior to back that sentiment up as sort   of a healthy mom. The anti-love family is in a 
total deficit of affection, appreciation, warmth,   
[09:05](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=545) camaraderie and it's sadly and horrifically 
rooted in contempt and disgust for some, if not   all the family members, so children are just the 
recipients of such contempt from their parents.   There's a marked purposeful like nastiness 
due to the parents being either mentally ill   or having loads of self-hate themselves going 
on or a lot of their own unresolved trauma   and the family like acts out from a place of 
deep bitterness. some traits... You're bullied   
[09:35](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=575) at school, you come home and the message is &quot;what 
do you want me to do about it?&quot; You know? That's   that contempt. Vulnerability in a family in 
like this is usually made fun of if you're   vulnerable or if you're sensitive or if you're 
in trouble, they get entertainment out of that.   Sentiments like &quot;you don't need any help, your 
life is perfect,&quot; like that kind of stuff.   There can also be sort of a sadistic enjoyment 
when someone is failing or needs help. Parents   
[10:01](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=601) in these systems are really off about their 
responsibility about raising children. They are   totally narcissistically removed from that concept 
and there's a sick message in a family like,   if i'm miserable you're going to be 
miserable, which is just pretty nasty.   Children grow up in this heartbreak and in some of 
them become cold themselves or some of them become   painfully sensitive because growing up with 
a family like this, things are made to be so   
[10:32](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=632) personal. Even if you're born highly sensitive, 
it's like super personal in a family system like   this. In adults who grow up like this, usually 
struggle with expecting similar treatment from   friends and partnerships and bosses. That's what 
I mean by that. They are also usually confused   with kindness. Someone who comes from a family 
system like this and really struggle taking in   that they're lovable because that would spark 
off a lot of grief about what it was actually   
[11:00](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=660) like. So the thing to process this, the recovery 
idea, or the thing to work on in therapy,   is the betrayal of love and responsibility 
by holding the parents accountable for   not doing anything about their own highly toxic 
stuff. The person would have to also, um, spend   some time trying to buy into the concept of love 
and that they're lovable and what I mean about   that first part is growing up in a family system 
like this, is like, there's really you know,   
[11:28](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=688) the betrayal of like yeah I'm your mom, but I also 
have contempt and disgust for you. Like that's   a betrayal and holding the parents accountable 
for that they caused that - that's what I mean. Moving on, number four is what I call the 
chaos system. This is children just growing   up in severe chaos and the parents being 
sort of like highly chaotic themselves.   There could be multiple moves. There could 
be parents getting divorced and back together   
[11:56](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=716) several times. There could be severe poverty or 
survival mode, there could be multiple affairs,   there could be high, high drama amongst the adults 
up top. You know, like dad moves out on a Tuesday   and he's back in the home on Thursday. In a system 
like this, there can be a lot of broken promises   and the family is weirdly familiar with the 
fast-moving chaotic changes so much that   they assume that that's kind of how life 
is. It can also be domestically chaotic.   
[12:25](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=745) What I see, it's sad, but it's like a total loss 
of basics for children such as like clean laundry,   stable consistent schooling, stable food, basic, 
basic needs. It's sad that often the children in   a system like this are treated as almost like 
pets, like once the parents feel like food and   shelter is established, that that's all you 
need. Children will struggle with shame and   they will try to start to get their needs met like 
from other people like from friends and teachers   
[12:54](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=774) and that's a very shameful experience to put a 
child up to because things are so chaotic at home.   What it's like for having for adult clients who 
grow up in this is, I often have clients who grow   up with addicts and or where they were in the 
military and they were moved around a lot. They   might struggle, I know that this sounds weird, 
is that adults who grow up like this may struggle   with moving into an apartment and actually 
unpacking, because you know sort of establishing   
[13:21](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=801) themselves or establishing an apartment is 
something that they don't necessarily know   how to do because they're so familiar with it's 
like &quot;later for that, I don't know how to do that,   it's not that important, survival is important.&quot; 
Disassociation is a common one - which makes a   lot of sense to me because these children aren't 
helped with catching up from one chaotic thing to   the next, there's not parenting around that and 
my clients who grow up on this often need to do  
[13:46](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=826) work around belonging to a group or a place 
or in a partnership or something. They're   also usually fiercely independent due 
to the shame for having grown up in this   which is a way to protect themselves. They are 
still, you know, it's interesting that client that   comes into me who grew up like this, they're 
still sort of an emotionally in transit, um,   and it's really good for them to process about 
what got lost for them sort of along the way in   
[14:14](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=854) a childhood like that. Clients growing up in this 
can be highly intense about cleanliness or money   or lack or stability or expectations or they may 
deeply struggle with organization themselves.   They may literally not know how to clean up or be 
organized. The thing to maybe process with this in   your healing journey or in therapy, is grieving 
about the lack of stability and consistency   while holding the parents accountable for 
being so loose with the child's development. 
[14:45](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=885) So number three is toxic divorce slash loyalty. 
This is another common on. I'm not saying divorces   are toxic. I actually think divorces are good 
modeling for children if a relationship isn't   working out. What I'm saying is if the 
children aren't helped in that process,   if there's bitterness and nastiness and 
poor co-parenting and resentments and   mess, that's when it becomes toxic. So 
that's what I mean. Some examples are,   
[15:12](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=912) and this is a big one, usually up front in my mind 
is the concept of parent alienation - where kids   are sort of brainwashed about one parent due 
to the other parent being very vindictive or   mentally off. So there's really like a character 
assassination of one parent over the other.   There can also be step parents in the mix who 
are introduced, it's like it's really painful and   horrific that kids will go through a nasty divorce 
and shortly after a step parent is introduced   
[15:43](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=943) and that there's even now more abuse because 
that step parent is toxic. There could also   be that it's simply that, you know, there was no 
processing of the divorce at all - it doesn't have   to be sort of nasty co-parenting or anything but 
there's just no discussion it's a little bit like,   &quot;well dad's moving out, we're moving 
on, who wants to go to Chuck e Cheese?&quot;   and it's a surreal experience that no one 
is processing this big, huge life event.   
[16:09](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=969) Children in these scenarios are often 
asked to choose sides, um, sometimes   directly in verbatim or sometimes that's super 
indirect like through like parent alienation.   Even if a step parent is a good person, kids feel 
like they're betraying their biological parents   by establishing a relationship with the step and 
kids also absorb the vibes of say a bitter parent,   um, because children are heart based and they 
will absorb the resentment of this parent as a   
[16:37](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=997) way to ally with them and to sort of take care of 
them and what the cost is is the the relationship   with the other parent is greatly compromised 
because of that so it's really important for   co-parents and divorced parents to not talk poorly 
about the other parent like hopefully we know that   more now. In adulthood, people who come from this 
family system are most likely going to struggle   with trust and intimacy. They are going to have 
issues about not feeling protected, like you know,   
[17:04](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1024) dad has a need dad marries an evil stepmom and 
they're not protective, that's where that sort of   uh triggering and accountability and rage comes 
from which might go on our partners as I mentioned   in other videos um and the idea of thoughtless 
and oblivious, there's a great example about   that of having trigger issues around people who 
are thoughtless and oblivious, if you come from   a family system like this or actually any of 
these family systems. Adults who come from   
[17:32](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1052) these systems like this also really struggle with 
taking sides. They may also have like a big body   reaction if there's conflict even if they're not 
involved in that conflict. A classic thing is like   co-worker A and B, they're having a fight and 
if you're a child of divorce, that can really   unravel you even though it doesn't involve you. 
Our inner children may secretly feel deep down,   this is a big issue that I talk about 
with my clients, that loving relationships   
[18:00](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1080) are sort of a lie - that healthy marriages 
aren't really true and given their experience,   you can sort of see why. But I also sort of teach 
my clients to think about, or the concept of,   what our parents model about marriage and intimacy 
becomes our blueprint for it. Which is like,   oh that's a big thing that we need to kind of 
wrestle with and unravel because we have to   establish a new idea of healthy relationships 
because that old blueprint is so compromised. 
[18:34](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1114) So the thing to process with this one is I 
think mainly the concept of choosing sides,   but also to process the heartbreak of having 
some parents being labeled as bad or character   assassinated or that parent alienation sort 
of stuff because it's like children are   sort of set up for that sort of toxic 
loyalty stuff and also a recovery idea   is to think about what kind of conversations 
did you need as a child from your parents   
[19:02](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1142) if they were healthy about that divorce or 
introducing a step parent and all that jazz. Moving on is number two - 
is being a single parent.   Being a single parent when it's not by choice. I 
can't imagine how stressful that is and I'm not   saying that being a single parent is bad but here 
are some examples where my clients who have had a   single parent where it becomes abusive. So it's 
when the kid was the actual adult and it's an   
[19:32](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1172) upside down thing and the single parent was really 
more like the child. That there was codependency   between the child and the parent because the 
parent treated the child uh as like a confidant,   as more like a friend as more like a sister than 
it being sort of like I'm the adult parenting you.   Kids growing up in this will have to like make 
themselves totally selfless due to the stress   of the parent being on their own, they are raising 
themselves, they are doing everything themselves,   
[20:00](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1200) that kind of a thing and even that stuff can be 
like just non-fault circumstance stuff. Often   there are way too many sort of either boyfriends 
or girlfriends or step adults in this child's life   without the parent really thinking 
about the impact of that on the child.   That shows that a single parent might have lived 
in a very messy lifestyle or was potentially   very immature and not protective. Even sadly 
that the the single parent may be extremely   
[20:29](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1229) limited and it's super hard to hold them 
accountable meaning that the single parent   is like &quot;I don't know how to drive, i don't know 
how that works, I'm not doing anything like that&quot;,   like really limited and that the child 
would have to just make accommodations and   figure out their life without those 
sort of basic, sort of resources   and this is hard but I've often had clients 
who have a single parent and who made their   
[20:51](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1251) child out to be like energy that's like you 
ruined my life that the child feels like   such a burden and that message is coming from 
that toxic adult from a place of intense blame,   blaming them for their existence which is brutal. 
Adults who grew up like this can exhibit, I call   it like a superhero complex, to cover up the shame 
or they sort of were a superhero making everything   happen for this, for this parent or or making 
the the system work. They will struggle with   
[21:21](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1281) the void of the lost biological parent. It's rare 
that there was a connection there. They may feel   like they struggle in life feeling that they're a 
burden to everybody or everything is their fault,   they may feel like they ruin people or ruin 
situations. They may really struggling with   holding others accountable and I think the thing 
to process this in your recovery or in therapy or   whatever, is that you didn't ask for that and 
you didn't ask to be considered as a burden   
[21:48](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1308) or you need to process the immense feelings of 
responsibility that shouldn't have been yours. Number one, the final one, and then we're gonna 
do an additional one after that, is probably   the most common one. You guys are probably more 
familiar with this. This is what I call aggressor   codependent. This one is very common, very 
familiar. One of the parents is rageful,   violent, toxic has some cluster b stuff going on 
or is substance addicted and the other parent is   
[22:23](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1343) codependent and doesn't protect or doesn't 
leave. I know that that's loaded and I know   that that's complicated but this is just, 
I'm looking at that system from how I sort   of see this. Some examples... the kids witness the 
co-dependent avoid or try to make things work even   if that parent is being abused, so there's that 
witnessing of all that. Kids will take care of the   codependent and that codependent parent may allow 
that kind of caretaking to happen. The abusive or   
[22:51](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1371) the aggressor usually holds things hostage, like 
the money, the job, the house which is a really   rageful kind of like really oppressive kind 
of system issue. The system is usually locked   and dancing around the aggressor's feelings 
and the co-dependent parent is probably   teaching that dancing. Kids witness a toxic power 
struggle like coming back to if I ask a client,   &quot;what did your parents model for you?&quot; This 
family is modeling that relationships are a power   
[23:22](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1402) struggle or a hostage crisis or both. That's what 
I mean about that concept. For adults who grow   up in a system like this, they will struggle with 
trust. They most likely, what I see, hold a lot of   internal rage about accountability, about people 
not being protective, that kind of a thing. They   can find themselves in codependent relationships 
themselves, they can be very familiar with toxic   people, they can be very triggered about not 
feeling protected or heard from their partner,   
[23:50](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1430) like that's where all the rage kind of goes that 
should be going to that co-dependent parent.   The thing to process or some things to process, 
and this one in your healing journey or recovery,   is that it's usually the codependent parent that 
we're going to be needing to do most of the work   on. We might see them as a victim, we might see 
them as a tragic figure, we might have seen them   as sort of doing their best, but there is a lot 
of work to do with the safer parent because it's   
[24:14](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1454) almost like the aggressor is sort of a no-brainer 
and hopefully that makes sense meaning it's so   like loud and obvious that that person is sort 
of toxic that we don't need to kind of like   figure it out so much. But there is a lot of 
wounding that happens with the aggressor. But   again, most of my clients have to do their work 
so a lot of work around the codependent parent. So there's that. 
[24:52](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1492) An honorable mention in this list is for those 
children that grow up in adopted families   or foster care. While it's not super common, 
is I do want to include it because it's sort of   I feel like there's not enough voice to that 
in some of these videos. So kids growing up   being displaced or having multiple caregivers or 
what I call like fast-switching or fast-moving   attachments is really detrimental to a child. We 
all can understand that, we all kind of get that.   
[25:20](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1520) All of the moving and loss usually causes kids 
to disassociate, meaning leaving their emotional   safe body and go up into their heads thinking 
about what is the next move, what's the next   thing that's going to happen. That's pretty much 
a definition of trauma. In all of these families,   kids would be leaving their bodies and going into 
their heads - that's what I mean by that. So for   those who are adopted and in foster care or have 
several families to process rather than one, so   
[25:49](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1549) the healing piece in that is they have to process 
their biological parents, they may have the   process like that good family that they were with 
for six months and then the really nasty family   that they were with for three years. So there's 
a lot of processing. So I wanted to mention that. So that was the list. I wanted to let you know 
that how you can use this list as a resource is to   first write down the types of family systems that 
you really resonate with. You can be from a single   
[26:18](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1578) parent system as well as a chaotic system and 
one that also falls into the anti-love category.   So those are three lenses to really look 
at where we come from and what kind of   appropriate issues given where we come from, are 
we going to be looking at to work on. I'd also   have you include some major personal details 
about your story. Like dad was a narcissist,   siblings were acting out and being abusive, mom 
had affairs or she was a drinker or that an uncle   
[26:49](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1609) stayed with you and there was an abused kind of 
component to that uncle. So that's what I mean,   I did my best to give a ballpark of each sort of 
family system but you're going to be personalizing   it as you sort of do this. If you'd like to write 
out your own genogram, like those jpegs that I had   on the screen, that's just one nuclear family, 
but there's there's generations going on in the   genogram. You can check out the e-course that 
I have on my website - if you want to do one   
[27:14](https://youtu.be/upAdaOmiRX8?si=N4RzdGPi1Jcl985e&t=1634) thoroughly for insight and perspective about your 
own sort of story and that's all up on my website. So I hope this video was helpful to you guys and 
as always may you be filled with loving kindness,   may you be well, may you be peaceful and at ease,   may you be joyous. Take 
care and I'll see you later.

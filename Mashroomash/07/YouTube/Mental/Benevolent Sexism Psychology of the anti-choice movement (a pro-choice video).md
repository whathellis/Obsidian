[00:00](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=0) hello and welcome back to political psych with 
Abby a channel where I talk about the psychology   of politics given the content of this video I'm 
not going to be doing any self-promotion in it so   I'll just tell you right now please check out my 
social media and like And subscribe thanks also if   you feel like supporting the channel on patreon 
that's totally awesome you get some cool perks   and it does really help anyway with that out of 
the way let's get started so part of the reason   
[00:23](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=23) there hasn't been a new video in a while is that 
I spent the summer teaching political psychology   to a group of high schoolers it was really cool 
to get to teach in person plus if any of them   may just respectful comments I could get them in 
trouble I'm mostly kidding you guys are mostly a   great audience anyway in the very first class one 
of the students asked if we were going to cover   the abortion debate I actually hadn't planned on 
it but I realized in that moment that I had to I   
[00:47](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=47) also realized that I should probably cover it 
here too for my class I covered the psychology   of the abortion debate at the end of my lecture 
on benevolent and hostile sexism and this video   can be considered an addendum to my video on 
benevolent in hostile sexism honestly I cannot   believe I did not think to cover abortion directly 
in that video in my defense that video was already   41 minutes long in light of all that in this 
video I'm mostly going to be covering abortion   
[01:12](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=72) from the perspective of benevolent in hostile 
sexism which won't give a complete picture but   does give a different valuable perspective 
on the issue so that you don't have to watch   my longer video on ambivalent sexism first I will 
briefly Define the components of ambivalent sexism   which are benevolent and hostile sexism basically 
benevolent sexism or BS gotta love that acronym   consists of a set of assumptions about women that 
might seem complementary but are actually limiting   
[01:40](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=100) for example the view of women as inherently 
more nurturing than men is benevolently sexist   because being nurturing isn't bad but ascribing 
that quality to women as a whole causes one to   view them as suited for certain gender roles and 
reinforces patriarchal structures basically the   person who does or thinks something benevolently 
sexist does not do it out of a hatred that they   are aware of hostile sexism consists of more 
overtly negative views about women importantly   
[02:09](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=129) different situations can lead to different 
women receiving hostile or benevolent sexism   but benevolent sexism is never actually good 
also many people are both benevolently sexist   and hostily sexist but BS is more common in women 
than hostile sexism is all right let's talk about   abortion first off I will admit my own bias I 
am pro-choice in basically all scenarios but   you probably already guessed that from the overall 
Vibe of this channel it is not my goal with this   
[02:40](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=160) video to persuade anti-choice people of my views 
and I will not debate you in the comments but I do   encourage you to stick around my goal here is to 
explain the psychology of the anti-choice position   so that knowledge can be applied by pro-choice 
activists you might be wondering why I'm using   the terms prone anti-choice instead of terms 
like pro-life and pro and anti-abortion I don't   use the term pro-life as I do not believe that a 
cluster of cells is the same thing as a person but   
[03:06](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=186) also many so-called pro-life activists abdicate 
policies which would lead to the deaths of a lot   of pregnant women I don't use the terms Pro and 
anti-abortion because it is different than that   I and many other pro-choice people don't actually 
specifically want abortions to happen we want   people to be able to make choices about their 
bodies and lives and to be able to access health   care in addition attempting to decrease the 
number of abortions by providing say better   
[03:35](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=215) Social Services could technically be anti-abortion 
without necessarily being anti-choice I do also   want to say before we fully get into things that 
I acknowledge that people who do not identify as   women can become pregnant and those people's 
identities are valid the reason I use the term   women other than for simplicity's sake and focus 
on attitudes towards women is that perceptions of   pregnancy motherhood and abortion are very closely 
linked to perceptions of Womanhood in addition   
[04:03](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=243) the point of this video is to understand the 
psychology of anti-choice people and those people   are unlikely to conceptualize anyone who can get 
pregnant as anything other than a woman although   obviously I don't want to assert that their 
conceptualization is correct here alright with   that caveat out of the way let's dive into things 
I think it's important to provide context in terms   of how many people hold different positions 
on abortion in the United States this issue   
[04:27](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=267) is often presented as having two equal sides but 
numbers wise that just isn't true Osborne at all   analyzed American opinion on a variety of abortion 
scenarios 43.8 percent of Americans sampled were   consistently pro-choice but only 14.8 percent were 
consistently anti-choice and even those people had   a one-quarter chance of supporting abortion if 
a woman's health was in danger they're doing   some kind of nuanced statistics here but the main 
point is that people have more than two possible   
[04:58](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=298) views on abortion and that the proportion of 
Americans who are truly opposed to abortion in   every instance is very small in order to reflect 
how people think about this issue more accurately   it is common to divide abortions into two types 
the first of these types is traumatic abortions   meaning that carrying the pregnancy to term 
jeopardizes the Woman's Health there was a   strong chance of birth defects or the pregnancy as 
the result of rape it's important to keep in mind   
[05:23](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=323) that this does not mean that the abortion itself 
is traumatic in fact in almost all traumatic   abortions the abortion is a way of avoiding 
additional trauma the other type is an elective   abortion in which a woman has some other reason 
to not not want to carry the pregnancy to term   okay now that we've defined the terms let's get to 
the core of things precisely Osborne at all found   in their meta-analysis that benevolent sexism 
not hostile sexism best explained opposition   
[05:52](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=352) to abortion what this essentially means is that 
people who are anti-choice do not necessarily   hate women as much as they want to control them 
which is still bad but in a different way the   conceptualization of women as inherently maternal 
is really key to this viewing them in as motherly   or maternal is not inherently hostile there are 
certainly some people who would be flattered to   be viewed as maternal the issue here is viewing 
women as inherently Bound for roles as mothers   
[06:22](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=382) for people who buy into this form of BS gender 
role abortion is seen as a massive violation of   this role tragically a mother's suffering is seen 
as a noble aspect of this gender role Osborne at   all use the chilling term sacrificial mothers well 
I do think parents should be willing to sacrifice   for their children the fixation on the sacrificial 
mother in the anti-choice movement goes far beyond   that many in this movement oppose traumatic 
abortions because they believe that it is a   
[06:55](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=415) woman's role to suffer her for her quote unquote 
child even if that child is just a collection of   cells even if that child has no real chance at 
living and even if that suffering includes the   woman's death or more suffering than she could 
possibly handle when I was trying to decide on   the image to represent the sacrificial mother here 
I was originally thinking of using something from   a horror movie and then it dawned on me that the 
best example was actually from something that's   
[07:25](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=445) supposed to be a love story I think that actually 
encapsulates something important about this this   image is Bella from Twilight who is being killed 
by the vampire fetus within her and has portrayed   as heroic for continuing the pregnancy she does 
end up living as does the baby who is perfectly   healthy aside from crippling cgitis because it's 
not the sort of story where the heroine dies a   pointless death unfortunately it's not like most 
women going through pregnancy complications can   
[07:55](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=475) cure themselves with vampire blood it just isn't 
covered under most insurance it is also worth   noting that this story was written by a woman who 
is also a mother the connection between benevolent   sexism and anti-choice attitudes is one of the 
reasons why the discrepancy see between men and   women on this issue is not as big as you might 
expect because unfortunately women commonly hold   benevolently sexist attitudes FYI the intention of 
this video is definitely not to call out Stephanie   
[08:25](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=505) Meyer specifically that's not the sort of thing 
this channel is for Twilight was just to get an   illustrative example to pass up we should also 
ask whether hostile sexism or in other words   hating women connect to opposition to abortion 
well Osborne at all did find a connection between   opposition to elective abortion and hostile sexism 
they hypothesize that this is because women who   seek elective abortions are choosing to deviate 
from gender roles .traditional views on gender tie   
[08:55](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=535) Womanhood and motherhood very closely together 
and also look down on female sexual Liberation   it is typical for women and others who deviate 
from traditional gender roles to receive more   hostile sexism Osborne at all also hypothesized 
that part of the connection here is that people   tend to connect elective abortion with feminism 
and feminists and feminists often incur a lot   of hostile sexism yet again this comes back to 
a perceived violation of gender rules I should   
[09:23](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=563) mention that some Studies have found no connection 
between hostile sexism and abortion attitudes   and one study I'm aware of found no connection 
between benevolent sexism and abortion attitudes   however in this video I'm attempting to focus 
on the most common conclusions and those drawn   from a meta-analysis meta-analyzes are studies of 
studies so they have a larger sample size and are   less likely to fall victim to any weirdness 
of sample or methodology that might affect   
[09:50](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=590) one study I am not intending to be dismissive 
of dissenting studies just trying to present   what is most likely the truth based on existing 
evidence what is most likely is the benevolent   sexism influences attitudes towards both elective 
and traumatic abortions and that hostile sexism   primarily influences attitudes towards elective 
abortions that means that we should probably   examine the benevolently sexist views held by 
anti-choice people and relating to the issue   
[10:20](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=620) fortunately Dirksen and Lawson have done just that 
I should mention that their sample is Canadian   but given that patriarchy is patriarchy on both 
sides of the Border I imagine the results will   carry ooop and over I should also mention that my 
choice to use interviews with Anonymous research   participants rather than high-profile activists 
or organizations is deliberate I am seeking to   communicate the attitudes of a group rather than 
the rhetoric of their leaders I'm also trying   
[10:49](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=649) to avoid straw Manning as well as whatever the 
opposite of straw Manning is like presenting a   position as more coherent and reasonable than it 
typically is does anyone know what that's called   comment below also this is a nice way to avoid 
platforming official anti-choice rhetoric more   than I need to in a quest to understand this 
the authors interviewed a number of people   with anti-choice views and found three main 
themes protective paternalism complementary   
[11:17](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=677) gender differentiation and the categorization of 
women I'm going to go through some quotes that   illustrate these attitudes now FYI while there 
isn't anything graphic these might be unpleasant   to listen to for some people I'll put in chapter 
markers so just skip to the conclusion if you   don't feel like hearing this today alright 
so let's start with protective paternalism   this has very little to do with actually 
protecting women from physical or emotional   
[11:45](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=705) harm it's actually about protecting them from 
getting to make their own choices you can't   see it because I'm not on camera but I was just 
making the biggest air quotes there protective   paternalism influences views on abortion a number 
of ways one of these is the assumption that women   will experience grief after an abortion and 
that they should be protected from that grief   one participant described it as I would almost 
say it's like a death of someone in their family   
[12:16](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=736) just that real grieving process um I don't think 
there'd be any relief I think that it's a loss not   just as if someone's died in your life but also 
like you were the reason for it it is important   to assert that this grief and regret is not a 
common post-abortion experience so this is an   effort to quote unquote protect women from 
something that rarely happens one of the   participants said the following about regret 
when the baby is there you take it for granted   
[12:50](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=770) that I could be able to get pregnant I had the 
possibility I was able I was capable to do that   when you lose the baby there are risks of never 
getting pregnant and you may you may be regret   that what if I just had my baby shame is another 
thing that anti-choice Advocates claim to want to   protect women from although of course they are 
responsible for much of the shame women who get   abortions may feel one participant described it 
as they feel ashamed that they shouldn't have done   
[13:24](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=804) it or they shouldn't have gotten pregnant and all 
these things it breaks my heart it is also common   for anti-choice people to assert that any relief 
a woman might feel post-abortion is false there   is this infantilizing assumption that women cannot 
accurately convey or judge their own experiences   and emotions one anti-choice participant said the 
following in reference to the shout your abortion   hashtag they're grieving silently and putting up 
a brave strong face that they are proud of their   
[13:58](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=838) abortion like I also grieve with them because 
it's possible that they are grieving silently   this honestly just comes off as so condescending 
there was also some but less frequent discussion   of women experiencing other negative 
emotions including guilt fear and Trauma   the real takeaway here is that the protective 
attitude towards women is based on not trusting   them to make their own choices and understand 
their own experiences and that these protective   
[14:29](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=869) attitudes do not actually protect women at 
all but instead control and infantilize them   that is not to say that no woman has ever 
had a bad or even horrible experience with   getting an abortion but these experiences 
are not the majority and do not justify   taking away this Choice anti-choice views also 
frequently relate to beliefs in complementary   gender differentiation that's basically 
fancy social science talk for gender roles   
[14:55](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=895) in the context of the abortion debate it means 
that anti-choice people believe that women would   not naturally choose abortion because women are 
made to be mothers because of this women who   seek abortions are often seen as misled coerced or 
lacking in other choices one participant described   how they believed women were misled thusly I 
think that in most cases women were truly looking   for the best decision to make and were maybe 
given wrong or misleading information I should   
[15:23](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=923) point out here that most wrong or misleading 
information about this issue is pushed by   anti-choice activists sometimes they're even able 
to legally Force others to give out this false   information another participant described how they 
believed women are coerced into abortions this way   you do know that it's often in the majority of 
cases of women getting abortions it's not always   the choice has been pushed on them they've never 
actually had the choice you know that right yet   
[15:55](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=955) again this is not true but it is what anti-choice 
people tend to believe anti-choice people also   tend to believe that women who get abortions 
must feel like they have no other choices with   one participant saying they feel like they have 
no other choice than to get an abortion and really   that's not making a decision that's being forced 
into something they don't really want she's being   forced by the idea that the only way she can 
finish her education is if she gets an abortion   
[16:21](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=981) or she's being forced by the fear that she won't 
have enough money to pay for food or rent or that   she'll end up homeless this is where I think 
our society has really failed woman because   they have been told that having a baby in any 
situation like that is going to ruin their life   women in these situations don't feel supported to 
have the child that they maybe have already fallen   in love with this is the hardest of these quotes 
for me to entirely disagree with I absolutely   
[16:47](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=1007) think that we as a society should provide more 
support to parents and children but this takes it   much farther than that here there is an assumption 
that any woman given the choice wants to become a   mother and that's simply not true in addition 
in the U.S at least being anti-choice tends to   overlap with being opposed to the sort of programs 
that would actually provide an alternative to   abortion or poverty I agree abortion or poverty 
is a horrifying choice and I want to live in a   
[17:15](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=1035) society in which no one has to get an abortion 
in order to avoid poverty however it is better   to have that choice than to just force people 
into poverty or further into poverty what is   interesting is that arising from this notion 
that women are not really making a free informed   choice to get abortions it's a belief among some 
anti-choice people the women who get abortions   should not be punished or judged although of 
course we see this view as not Universal as   
[17:42](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=1062) more and more places Institute punishments for 
women who get abortions however this may be the   reason that some anti-abortion activists Target 
abortion providers more than abortion Seekers the   final way that anti-choice thinking connects to 
ambivalent sexism is the categorization of women   participants stereotype women who seek abortions 
as young childless and promiscuous thus viewing   abortion as separate from family femininity and 
motherhood to quote Dirksen and Lawson failing   
[18:10](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=1090) to acknowledge that a woman can simultaneously 
fulfill a traditional role and choose abortion   serves to classify women who choose abortion 
into an inferior category of course though these   things are not as separate as many anti-choice 
activists would have you believe many women who   seek abortions do already have children many are 
in committed monogamous relationships or married   and many are older this categorization may also 
also be why anti-choice activists rarely discuss   
[18:39](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=1119) women who seek abortions for health reasons still 
abortion Seekers are stereotyped as young as in   these young girls they get pregnant it's got to be 
terrifying for them can you imagine like uh what   am I going to do are my parents going to disown me 
participants were baffled by the idea of women who   already had children getting abortions with one 
participant saying if a woman had three kids and   had an abortion and had three more kids honestly 
it would be like how I'd almost want to do a study   
[19:14](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=1154) on these people to understand how they justify 
it the eagerness to classify abortion Seekers   is promiscuous is also clear with participants 
saying gross things like really have a little bit   of self-control like I don't know less drugs less 
booze and you won't get pregnant so yeah as you   can see it's not so much that anti-choice people 
hate women at least not all women as that they   hold a number of incorrect but deeply ingrained 
beliefs about women if I had to boil down those   
[19:44](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=1184) beliefs into their simplest forms I would say 
that they are one a woman is inherently made to   be a mother and to seek to not be one is wrong 
and unnatural and two a woman can't be trusted   to make her own choices if we want to bring 
anti-choice people over to the pro-choice side   we need to dispel these beliefs if these beliefs 
cannot be dispelled then these people must be   organized around and circumvented fortunately we 
do outnumber them by a lot I wish I could leave   
[20:12](https://youtu.be/LsvtDTIDyZo?si=eHqo-sHs9S1A2Rft&t=1212) you with some message of togetherness and how 
we all really want the same and best things but   that would be dishonest truth be told anti-choice 
people really do view women in a very different   way than most of you probably do we really don't 
all think the same thanks for watching and thanks   to Sky mocha Ryan Bruno and Bretblock for Lending

Description:: This was supposed to be a fun silly video, but it ended up being an exploration of human nature in political contexts and a deconstruction of our founding myths. Actually that I think the same thing happened to the creators of 1776. Anyway enjoy, I promise there are still jokes.

# Transcript

[00:00](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=0) I've done some pretty heavy videos recently so 
I decided I deserve to have a little treat that   means I'm going to be talking about the musical 
1776 which I'm kind of obsessed with this will be   one of my more chill videos but it's still going 
to be educational and also not totally chill   because I do have to talk about slavery kind of a 
lot if you're new here welcome otherwise welcome   back I'm Abby and this is political psych with 
Abby on this channel I talk about the psychology   
[00:28](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=28) of politics if you enjoy this video it'd be 
awesome if you like subscribe comment follow   me on social media that kind of thing I don't 
usually talk about musicals although I actually   did one sort of about Hades town with my 
video about the psychology of solidarity   I would say that I have absolutely no special 
credentials when it comes to talking about   musicals in fact I am literally tone deaf so if 
anything I am less qualified than the average   
[00:58](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=58) person however in terms of talking about 1776 
from the perspective of political psychology   I'm your girl there are three main things I 
really love about 1776. the first one is how   human and flawed the portrayal of the founding 
fathers is not like they are torture Geniuses   but like they are as Petty and irrational and even 
horny as the rest of us in other words it's a very   psychological portrayal of politics hence why it's 
on this channel the second thing I really like is   
[01:30](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=90) how shockingly radical the play was for its time 
and to some extent still is something that the   New Stage production which I'll also talk about 
carries on wonderfully and then the third thing   I like is how fun and kind of cheesy but also 
genuinely well done this is I'm going to focus   on one and two in this video you kind of have to 
see the musical to get three I will mention that   while I'm going to talk primarily about the movie 
production of this show and the original script I   
[01:57](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=117) will also be discussing the recent Revival 
production I saw the Revival production in   person and thought it was great I want to mention 
that it has a racially diverse cast but not a race   blind casting also the cast of The Revival does 
not contain many if any people who would use he   him pronouns to refer to themselves but I will 
be using he him pronouns to refer to the male   characters as the Revival does not textually 
change the gender of the characters in other   
[02:24](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=144) words in the Revival people who are not men are 
still playing the characters as men also I'm not   going to be addressing any reviews of the Revival 
or any drama controversy because it is incredibly   out of my wheelhouse first things first I want to 
talk about why Richard Nixon did not want you to   see this at least not all of it Well he kind 
of wanted you to see it he wanted you to see   the raw raw America Parts but the song cool cool 
considerate men was cut from the original film   
[02:55](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=175) release because the head of the studio Jack Horner 
was pressured to do so by Nixon who was his buddy   Nixon did not like the song's portrayal of 
conservatives I get why it is just so [ __ ]   about conservatives it is fantastic it has them 
describe their own principles with lines like   to the right ever to the right never to the 
left where there's gold a market that will   hold tradition that is old or reluctance to 
be bold also it portrays conservatives as the   
[03:29](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=209) ones opposed to or at least hesitant about the 
American Revolution with lines like why should   we risk losing and the revolution is now key to 
conservative identity perhaps even more now than   it was in Nixon's day Jack Warner also wanted 
the film negatives of the number destroyed but   the editor secretly saved them and so now if you 
watch the film version it should have that number   included and the one you can buy on YouTube 
certainly does so yeah let no one ever tell   
[03:58](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=238) you censorship is rooted on the left because a 
surprising amount of the time it is rooted in   the studio head who served as a friendly witness 
to the house on American Activities Committee and   who was friends with the president who bombed 
Cambodia Nixon also wanted mama look sharp cut   from the performance of the musical at the White 
House originally this was surprising to me Mama   looks sharp is a sad ballad where a soldier 
Mourns a fallen comrade then I remembered the   
[04:26](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=266) Vietnam War and had a well-down moment Mama looks 
sharp is not necessarily an anti-war song but it   is definitely a song that is designed to make the 
audience question whether war is worth the cost   if an audience allows themselves to even question 
if the American Revolution was worth it imagine   what they would start to think about Vietnam also 
this song comes almost immediately after cool cool   considerate men juxtaposing the interests of the 
rich conservatives with the common Soldier one   
[05:02](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=302) could see why Jack Warner and Richard Nixon would 
not like that the cast refused to perform the play   at the White House unless they kept all the songs 
in this was a genuinely Brave move in my view some   members of the cast were intimately acquainted 
with what could happen to you if your patriotism   was questioned Howard de Silva who played Benjamin 
Franklin in both the movie and the original stage   show had previously been blacklisted because 
he was investigated by the house on American   
[05:32](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=332) Activities Committee as an alleged communist 
because of his political activities impressively   the cast got the White House to agree to the 
performance of the whole show hen The Surreal   image that is this video's thumbnail apparently 
the cast saying the numbers Nixon did not want   sung with extra Vigor it is almost surprising that 
there is no record of Nixon or Warner requesting   that the song molasses to realm to Slaves or any 
of the other content about slavery be cut because   
[06:01](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=361) this play is at its most radical and honest when 
covering slavery like this play tackles slavery   in a more head-on way and makes fewer excuses 
for the founding fathers than nearly any other   content about the American Revolution I have seen 
and I'm including serious documentaries and books   that should be embarrassed to be outflanked by a 
fun musical from the 60s on this I am mostly going   to be talking about this in terms of political 
psychology and 1776 specifically if you want an   
[06:34](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=394) overview of the actual discussions about slavery 
at the Continental Congress I am not your best   source this video is really not about historical 
accuracy but I do want to let you know that the   debate on the contents of the Declaration and the 
vote on the Declaration are in the opposite order   in the play to how they actually were in reality 
the vote came first this means the decision-making   process of the main characters of the play 
regarding slavery is different than it would have   
[07:03](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=423) been for their historical counterparts this is 
not at all to defend the historical counterparts   I do want to say that I cannot really bring myself 
to say that the creation of the United States was   worth any degree of complicity in the preservation 
of slavery like seriously while I might have some   admiration for some of these historical figures 
and the sort of fondness for Revolutionary War   history one gets from growing up surrounded by 
it I go back and forth on whether the war was   
[07:30](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=450) even worth it considering slavery remained and 
was actually abolished about 30 years earlier   in the British Empire that's a whole generation 
extra that lived through slavery here although   of course the British Empire here is also 
indefensible at least some of my fondness   for the American Revolution comes from a hatred of 
the British Empire nothing against modern Brits of   course though hell I'm married to one and he 
hates the Empire more than I do the shift in   
[07:57](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=477) focus to talking and singing about slavery in this 
play can seem sudden and intense it functions as   a sort of gut punch there's all this discussion 
of principles and high-minded rhetoric and then   in the middle of editing the Declaration and 
proceeded by a discussion of deep sea fishing   rights the viewer is made to realize that the 
characters in the show even the ones they've been   rooting for and the nascent country they have also 
been rooting for are at least partially complicit   
[08:28](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=508) in one of the worst atrocities in human history 
although on re-watching the play it can seem   haunted by slavery from the beginning the first 
hint of this is the lighthearted and catchy song   the leaves of old Virginia in this song Richard 
Henry Lee is listing his prominent relatives all   of whom seem to be contemporaries say for one 
blink and you'll miss it name and that name is   Bobby Lee or as we Damn Yankees would call him 
Robert E Lee the Confederate slavery defending   
[08:59](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=539) General and loser of the Civil War he was also 
Richard Henry Lee's nephew in order to confirm   this information I went to the website for the 
Lee family archive I have to share the final   sentence from their page entitled the leaves of 
Virginia an American Legacy it reads Harry Lee's   son Robert would also wage war on behalf of a 
rebel government but unlike Washington General   Lee's efforts would meet with a very different 
end well that certainly is an American Legacy   
[09:27](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=567) the place focus on slavery is clearer earlier 
on in the New Stage production partially this   is due to the diverse cast which makes it harder 
to not be thinking about race in America from the   beginning importantly this is a diverse cast and 
not race blind casting I really don't think having   some of the most vocal Defenders of slavery played 
by black people would have been a good idea but   I do think that involving people from different 
backgrounds especially African Americans in a play   
[09:59](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=599) with a heavy focus on slavery and race in America 
is a very good idea the diverse Ensemble and the   decreased need for realism of a Stage production 
rather than a film one also gives the production   the opportunity to have people on stage playing 
slaves in molasses to roam to Slaves which I   think is a good touch as it makes the people whose 
fate is being decided feel less theoretical also   in the modern production in the song the leaves 
of old Virginia they have various leaves standing   
[10:29](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=629) on rum and or molasses barrels in the background 
and one of them is in a very obvious Confederate   uniform now you might be asking why barrels well 
rum and molasses take a starring role in the song   Molasses to Rum to Slaves which is about slavery 
greed and profit especially in the context of the   triangle trade which involved both these Goods 
it is also about the complicity of the whole   burgeoning country not just slaveholders being 
a New Englander myself the line from Rutledge   
[11:03](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=663) a northern breath without feeling a bit tender 
towards our slaves they're in keep slaves no no   but they're willing to be considerable carriers 
of slaves to others they are willing for the   children brought on a healthy level of discomfort 
that most portrayals of slavery do not for me   we can also see here that Rutledge is trying to 
include Northerners in an identity that includes   profiting from slavery in the hopes this will 
make them more likely to defend slavery or at   
[11:32](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=692) least not actively attack it this is a pretty 
clever tactic from a psychological perspective   we're going to be talking more about the 
psychology of identity later in the video   from a psychological perspective the treatment 
of slavery in this play also emphasizes cognitive   dissonance cognitive dissonance is the distress 
that occurs when there is a mismatch between   behavior and attitudes typically according to this 
Theory there are three main ways people deal with   
[11:59](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=719) this dissonance firstly they could change one 
of the dissonant conditions this could be their   behavior but in a surprising number of cases 
people actually change their attitudes instead   secondly it could be trying to add things 
to their thought process that justify their   actions the third option is mentally decreasing 
the importance of these attitudes we actually   see different characters engage in all three of 
these strategies in 1776. Rutledge attempts to   
[12:27](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=747) convince the Northerners and others to go along 
with continuing slavery by emphasizing how they   will profit from its continuation and how their 
actions would have to seriously change if it ended   he sings Who sailed the ships out of Boston they 
didn't with Bibles in the room who drinks a toast   to the Ivory Coast hail Africa the sleepers have 
come New England with Bibles and rum basically   here he is saying that the whole economy would 
have to be overhauled if slavery were outlawed   
[13:01](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=781) and that this is not just true in the South keep 
in mind that most of the delegates are very rich   men who have done well under the current system 
Rutledge also tries out the third strategy by   making anti-slavery attitudes seem less important 
by saying it isn't moles it is money that saves   here he has explicitly placing profitable actions 
as more important than carrying out actions in   line with a moral attitude also this line is 
especially chilling as you could easily imagine   
[13:34](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=814) the villains of our day feeling the exact same 
way but most of them probably wouldn't say tis   Rutledge does not do as much adding things to the 
thought process as he does the other strategies   but Jefferson clearly does this to himself when 
Rutledge asks Jefferson about his slaves Jefferson   replies I have already resolved to release my 
slaves here Jefferson is adding the fact that he   has resolved to release his slaves to his thought 
process so he can mentally justify keeping them   
[14:06](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=846) to quote the website of Monticello Jefferson's 
estate Thomas Jefferson freed two people during   his life he freed five people in his will he 
allowed two or three people to escape without   Pursuit and recommended informal freedom for 
two others in total of the more than 600 people   Jefferson enslaved he freed only 10 all members 
of the same family so yeah maybe he alleviated   some of his own cognitive dissonance but this is 
still an egregious moral failing the treatment of   
[14:39](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=879) slavery in this play also hits harder because of 
how human and how psychological this play makes   its characters so now I'm going to start breaking 
it down in terms of psychological Concepts that   we can understand how the plague crafts these 
deeply psychological characters and scenarios   the first of these Concepts I want to talk about 
is issue framing basically what that is is talking   about an issue in certain ways to change the way 
people think about them and maybe even what side   
[15:08](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=908) of an issue they find themselves on what is super 
cool about 1776 from the perspective of framing is   that it uses theatrical framing to emphasize the 
ways the characters are engaging in issue framing   very rhetorically meta the original production 
of the play as well as the Revival start with   John Adams in front of the curtain framing the 
situation as he sees it by saying I have come   to the conclusion that one useless man is called 
a disgrace that two are called the law firm and   
[15:38](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=938) that three or more become a congress and by 
God I've had this Congress for 10 years King   George and his Parliament have gold colored 
and diddled these colonies with their illegal   taxes Stamp Acts Townshend Acts sugar acts 
TX and when we dared stand up like men they   have stopped our trade seized our ships blockaded 
our ports burned our towns and Spilled our blood   and still this Congress refuses to Grant any of 
my proposals on Independence even so much as the   
[16:08](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=968) courtesy of open debate this is an especially 
interesting use of framing in the 2022 Revival   because in that production John Adams is played 
by a black woman who Begins the show standing in   front of the curtain with a painting of the actual 
Continental Congress who were all white men on it   this actually calls attention to the themes of 
race and to a lesser extent gender the Revival   chooses to focus on so clearly that I had to go 
home after I saw it to see if the same speech was   
[16:36](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=996) in the original play which it is exactly the 
same as far as I can tell regardless of who   plays John Adams this section still serves as a 
framing device for the rest of the play Framing   is basically a constant theme in this play about 
the framers of the Declaration please excuse the   awful pun the whole writing of the Declaration of 
Independence can be seen as an attempt to control   the framing of the Revolutionary War this is true 
historically as well as in the play although I   
[17:05](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1025) should mention that the largest Liberty the play 
takes with its history is that a versus the vote   on Independence and the writing of the Declaration 
historically the vote came first which honestly   seems crazy to me but I think this is because as 
Americans we are taught to view the Declaration   as a key element of an independence movement but 
at the time this precedent would not have existed   anyway regarding framing John Dickinson who is 
in many ways the antagonist of the play but is   
[17:36](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1056) undeniably fun to watch delivers the line Mr 
Jefferson Are you seriously suggesting that we   publish a paper declaring to all the world that 
an illegal Rebellion is in reality a legal one   of course basically what the Declaration did and 
I would say it was pretty successful considering   that almost everyone views the United States 
as a real country and the Revolutionary War is   commonly viewed as very legitimate even though 
at the time it was of course completely illegal   
[18:07](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1087) Franklin further emphasizes framing by 
responding to Dickinson with the line   you should know that Rebellion is always legal 
in the first person such as our Rebellion   it is only in the third person their Rebellion 
that it is illegal this line brings in framing   around identity that we will discuss more later 
also I just love this line Franklin is such a scap   honestly the only founding father that I think 
was actually pretty cool in real life although   
[18:43](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1123) not totally unproblematic of course if you ever 
want to feel really bad about how little you've   done in your life read a biography of Benjamin 
Franklin there is also a quite intense discussion   between Jefferson and Dickinson about whether 
King George should be described as a tyrant this   might seem like an inconsequential issue of word 
choice but is absolutely not as Jefferson sums up   by saying when a king becomes a tyrant he thereby 
breaks the contract binding his subjects to him   
[19:13](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1153) now I am personally very anti-monarchy generally 
but you have to remember that in this period kings   were the norm typically seen as good but tyrants 
tyrants you could justifiably rebel against   this is probably why this is one of the few 
edits of the Declaration that Jefferson refuses   to accept but the characters in 1776 are not 
all Grand rhetoric although there's a lot of   that in many ways the real strength of the play 
is in the humanity of the characters they mirror   
[19:48](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1188) real political actors in all eras in that they 
can be Petty and irrational like the rest of us   let's start with pettiness because I love drama 
especially dramatizations of really old drama   atoms as a character is constantly striving to 
separate the personal and the political probably   because as a person he is obnoxious and disliked 
as the play puts it whereas Franklin who in the   play as well as in many historical accounts 
was a charismatic people person understands   
[20:23](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1223) melding person and politics a big part of that 
is having ideas presented by the right person   hence why Franklin decides that the widely liked 
Richard Henry Lee should be the one to introduce   the Declaration of course this is not just Lee's 
personality but also his identity as a southern   Aristocrat that makes him a good candidate to 
introduce the Declaration we will get into the   identity stuff later boy howdy will we get into it 
and yes as I mentioned before he is one of those   
[20:57](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1257) leaves anyway there is actual science to back up 
the idea that a politician's perceived personality   impact support for them for example koppensteiner 
and Stefan found that when people watch clips of   politicians they preferred politicians who 
they saw as having personality traits they   value in themselves this is pretty obvious that 
we are biased in favor of people we find likable   even in political situations but I like that this 
play does not treat the Founding Fathers as immune   
[21:28](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1288) from that but it's not just pettiness love which 
may not be rational but is beautiful is also an   ongoing theme in the play this love is anything 
but pure the play wants you to imagine the   Founding Fathers as downright horny look up a song 
called he plays the violin from this musical just   do it I dare you this plays focus on interpersonal 
relationships including romantic relationships and   the impact politics has on those relationships 
is something I find very interesting and very   
[22:03](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1323) important in my video on dating across political 
divides I discuss how political differences can   cause tension in relationships however in this 
play what is focused on more is the strain that   political actions of one partner can have on the 
other partner in their relationship Abigail Adams   sums this up albeit in a semi-joking tone with 
the line think of it John to be married to the   man who's always first in line to be hanged for 
some reason that line is just relatable to me as   
[22:33](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1353) a woman named Abigail from Massachusetts married 
to a political radical can't possibly think why   okay in this next section I'm going to talk about 
Thomas Jefferson's sexual or romantic life and   crack some jokes about it but before that I want 
to acknowledge that after the events trade in   this play Thomas Jefferson raped his slave Sally 
Hemmings to quote from Vox DNA evidence has proved   that Jefferson and Hemmings had six children 
together while Jefferson kept hammings enslaved   
[23:04](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1384) and Jefferson also enslaved their children 
freeing them one by one as they came of age   to further complicate matters Sally Hemmings 
was a half-sister to Jefferson's late wife the   product of a relationship between Jefferson's 
father-in-law and one of his slaves by all   accounts Jefferson's sexual relationship with 
Hemmings spanned several decades beginning when   Hemmings was a teenager and Jefferson was in his 
40s it was not in any sense of the word consensual   
[23:35](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1415) Hemmings was a child and Jefferson literally 
owned her she was not in any position to give   or withhold consent it is probably better to think 
of my jokes and comments in this next section as   about the fictional character in the play not the 
real man although of course it is impossible to   separate them completely alright I can't come up 
with a good transition for this but let's get back   into things an entire scene of the play focuses 
on how Jefferson cannot write the Declaration   
[24:07](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1447) because he shall we say yearns for his wife he's 
not able to get it done until Franklin has his   wife come to Philadelphia this is where he plays 
the violin comes in there's actually probably a   pretty good lesson in there about how taking 
care of yourself and your allies personal needs   will help your political movement but this is also 
just a hilarious scene and really serves to bring   the founding fathers down to human scale this 
approach of focusing in on romantic relationships   
[24:38](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1478) of political figures is not necessarily something 
I want to relate to a specific study although it   has been found that people's social bonds 
do shape their Politics the real reason I   bring this up in a political psychology video is 
that I want to give the play a standing ovation   for really understanding the human element of 
politics which is also one of the key missions of   political psychology the founding fathers are also 
displayed in this play as very physically human   
[25:07](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1507) the very first song in the show is sit down 
John in which John Adams tries desperately to   get a vote on Independence and the rest of the 
Congress primarily complains about the weather   with lyrics like it's 90 degrees have mercy John 
please it's hot as hell in Philadelphia someone   ought to open a window I mean relatable I also 
cannot get anything done when it's hot out and   I have AC FYI this song is super catchy you will 
never be able to tell someone to open up a window   
[25:42](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1542) without singing again after you hear it there is 
some pretty strong evidence that temperature does   affect the way we think in ways very relevant to 
this situation Chima and Patrick found that people   are less likely to make complicated gambles in 
warmer weather now the complicated gamble they   focus on is a more complex type of lottery ticket 
but you know what is also the sort of complicated   gamble people might be less likely to make in hot 
weather starting a new country fun fact one of the   
[26:17](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1577) authors of this article is based at the University 
of Virginia which was founded by Thomas Jefferson   so this video is very indirectly brought to you by 
one of its own subjects anyway Chima and Patrick   also found that heat makes us rely on simpler 
ways of thinking makes us less willing to engage   in complicated decision making and decreases 
cognitive performance although it is worth noting   that they were focused on contacts like consumer 
decision making and copy editing not politics   
[26:49](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1609) where not quite the trolls and Terry Pratchett 
books but there is a real effect yeah 90 degrees   and no AC six layers of clothing good luck getting 
much done in the thinking and decision making   Department I should mention though that colonial 
era clothes while not great in the heat are not   quite as terrible as you might think I grew up 
in Lexington Massachusetts the town where the   American Revolution started and like a good little 
history nerd I spent the summer After High School   
[27:20](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1640) as a costumed guide in a historic house my outfit 
consisted of a shift that's sort of a cotton dress   you wear as underwear under your clothes it covers 
enough though that it would be a fairly modest   dress by modern standards on top of that I wore 
a petticoat which is basically a long skirt I had   to wear mine oddly high on my waist because they 
did not have one short enough I'm five foot two   I also wore an apron on top of the Petticoat on my 
top half I had a jacket which is really more of a   
[27:53](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1673) shirt but is called a jacket mine was one that 
wraps and ties around because that's what they   had in my size but ones that pinned clothes in the 
front are also very common they had buttons at the   time but it was considered scandalous for women to 
wear them or so I have been told then there was a   shawl worn over the jacket and a bonnet on my head 
I have been told this outfit was not very accurate   and I make no claim to be an expert anyway it was 
odd from a temperature perspective it sort of felt   
[28:27](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1707) like being wrapped in layers of thin blankets 
because all the fabric was natural and none of   it was very thick there was just a lot of it I 
did hear from colleagues though that the men's   outfits are worse in the summer which I would pin 
on thicker Fabrics if I had to guess bonnets suck   though let's never bring back bonnets that was 
a longer digression than I planned but yeah the   point I'm trying to make here is the importance of 
seeing historical and political figures as just as   
[28:57](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1737) human as the rest of us capable of bias but also 
of things like sweat and horniness and even love   Peter Stone who wrote the book for 1776 clearly 
understood that and viewed the humanity of the   Founding Fathers as key to the entertainment 
value of the play he wrote The Following about   the play 1776 was conceived as entertainment but 
if it is indeed entertaining it is I believe more   than the songs and the jokes and the theatricality 
that make it so it is the surprise of discovering   
[29:30](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1770) our founding fathers were men of Flesh and Blood 
and not cardboard now let's move on to how these   figures relate to each other like the rest 
of us a lot of these interactions are shaped   by perceptions of our identity especially what 
Collective identities we share one of the main   ways to understand political movements used in 
political psychology is called social identity   Theory I go into more detail about it in my video 
on solidarity anyway the gist of social identity   
[29:59](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1799) theory is that in order for a movement to occur 
people have to see themselves as members of a   group and have to see advancing the interests of 
the group as a more effective way of furthering   their interests than acting alone of course 
people do also act altruistically to advance   a group interest sometimes even the interest 
of a group that they are not a member of here   though I am going to be focusing on the defining 
and redefining of identities and their related   
[30:26](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1826) interests because that's what the play focuses on 
Adams and Dickinson have an exchange about whether   to separate from England that demonstrates the 
role of social identity rather neatly I'm going to   run through a section of it with some commentary 
along the way why Independence Mr Adams for the   obvious reason that our continued Association 
of Great Britain has become intolerable see here   Adams is trying to define a collective identity 
that includes himself and Dickinson and frame   
[30:54](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1854) Great Britain as external to that identity 
Dickinson continues by saying to who Mr Adams to   you then I suggest you sever your ties immediately 
but please be kind enough to leave the rest of us   where we are personally I have no objections 
at all to being part of the greatest Empire on   Earth to enjoying its protection and sharing its 
benefits here Dickinson tries to deny a collective   American identity and cling to and frame 
positively his identity as a British subject he   
[31:25](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1885) and Adams go back and forth like this for a while 
and if you want the whole thing you should see   the play it's great but I do want to highlight one 
more line Tom Tom Mr Adams if you have Grievances   and I'm sure you have our presence system must 
provide a gentler means of rejecting them short   of Revolution here he is asking Adams to act as 
an individual instead of taking Collective action   individual action being seen as effective 
does tend to discourage Collective action   
[31:55](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1915) this is also an element of social identity 
Theory I go more into on my video on solidarity   this is also to some extent an example of status 
quo bias although suggesting an alternative to   war largely over taxes is hardly an irrational 
action status quo biases not always terrible and   Dickinson at this point really does see the war 
as largely about things like taxes although Adams   has a grander vision shortly after this exchange 
we get Franklin saying the line nor would I were   
[32:30](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1950) I given the full rights of an Englishman but to 
call me one without those rights is like calling a   knocks a bull he's thankful for the honor but he'd 
much rather have restored what's rightfully his   pretty textbook example of perceived relative 
deprivation as an element of social identity   Theory relative deprivation means considering 
yourself or group deprived compared to the group   you are comparing yourself to considering 
your group deprived is pretty key to the   
[33:00](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=1980) social identity theory of change meaning that 
this comes right back around to issue framing   the play also focuses heavily on the way that 
different identities can be capitalized upon   to further goals for example Adams and Franklin 
decide to have Lee propose Independence because   he is a southerner and a wealthy one from a 
good read slave owning scumbag family at that   they need the wealthy Southerners on their 
side so they can get someone who the wealthy   
[33:30](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=2010) Southerners will see as embodying the best 
of their identity to Champion the cause of   Independence throughout the play there is also 
an ongoing attempt by the pro-independent side   to craft a positive unifying American identity 
for example there's an entire song about choosing   America's national bird which is also in a 
slyway about defining the American character   in spite of turkeys just being total [ __ ] I 
can't help finding myself agreeing with Franklin   
[34:01](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=2041) when he asserts the national bird should be 
a turkey because the eagle is a scavenger   a thief a coward and the symbol of more than 10 
centuries of European Mischief whereas turkey is   a truly Noble bird a native of America a source 
of sustenance to our settlers and an incredibly   Brave fellow I think the play Maybe wants you to 
wish you lived in the braver less old-fashioned   European less Scavenging less imperialistic turkey 
America rather than the eagle America we live in   
[34:35](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=2075) today but I am probably reading to mention to it 
although during this song in the new production   scenes from the good and the bad of American 
History are projected behind the actors so maybe   I'm not reading too much into it also of course 
the Declaration itself is part of the burgeoning   national Collective identity but isn't talking 
about birds more fun also now I really want a   turkey sandwich on rye with cheese we should also 
talk about the perceived Effectiveness element of   
[35:06](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=2106) social identity Theory basically people are more 
likely to take action if they believe that action   can be successful which I guess is pretty obvious 
but it's always nice to have double check these   things scientifically throughout the play many 
members of the Continental Congress are hesitant   to act because the war is going poorly and they 
believe they will lose one such character holds   these perceptions is Chase but hilariously he 
changes his mind when in the words of Franklin   
[35:33](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=2133) he saw a ragtag group of provincial militiamen 
who couldn't train together drill together or   March together but when a flock of ducks flew by 
and they saw their first dinner in three full days   sweet Jesus could they shoot together by the end 
we see Collective identity has been formed and   that the members of the Congress see themselves as 
able to succeed together and only together this is   summed up by Franklin saying if we don't hang 
together we shall assuredly hang separately as   
[36:03](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=2163) the delegates signed the Declaration what I've 
been trying to say with this video other than   that you should see 1776 in some form and piss off 
Richard Nixon is that this play takes the founding   fathers off their marble pedestals and makes us 
consider them as people I want to close with an   exchange between Franklin and Adams immediately 
after the decision to concede the slavery issue   Adams says Mark me Franklin if we give in on 
this issue posterity will never forgive us   
[36:33](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=2193) Franklin replies that's probably true but 
we won't hear a thing John we'll be long   gone and besides what will posterity think 
we were demigods We're Men no more no less   and that's the wonderful thing about 
1776 it shows you people it does not   ask you to treat the Founding Fathers as 
psychologically different from normal people   if we consider the Founding Fathers as fellow 
humans not inherently better or worse than that   
[37:07](https://youtu.be/TRWWfMRAPmY?si=PZBz5hf0Hsh7OakG&t=2227) it becomes easier to replicate their successes and

# Transcript
[00:00](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=0) so in this video I'm going to tell you about 
one of my favorite psychology theories moral   foundations Theory. as the kids say it's a 
problematic fave actually is that something   people younger than me say or is it like 
a millennial thing or am I just not cool   or saying it cringy now I don't know but 
I'm hoping my self-deprecation here will   guard me against ridicule anyway welcome back 
to political psych with Abby I'm Abby and on   
[00:28](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=28) this channel we talk about the psychology of 
politics I've talked about moral foundations   Theory before but I want to go into more depth 
and my viewers want me to too so here goes   basically moral foundations theory 
is a theory within psychology aimed   at explaining why morality and concepts 
of virtue vary across cultures or people   moral foundation's theory stands on four main 
claims the first claim is nativism meaning in this   
[00:56](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=56) context the humans have innate moral structures 
which are then built on and shaped by experience   essentially people can learn many moral Concepts 
but they learn some more readily than others   the second claim is cultural learning this is the 
idea that a person's morality is shaped by their   culture especially during development together 
these basically amount to the idea that an   individual's morality is the result of both nature 
and nurture the third claim is intuitionism which   
[01:27](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=87) in this context is the idea that people usually 
have moral intuitions first and consciously reason   deliberately about them second the fourth claim is 
pluralism the idea that our evolutionary ancestors   faced many Social Challenges and therefore over 
time developed many moral foundations to deal   with them pluralism has in my view been the 
most influential element of moral foundations   Theory and is the main thing that sets it 
apart from other theories moral pluralism   
[01:54](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=114) is an aspect of the theory that many researchers 
especially in the political realm have focused on   at the moment there are five moral foundations 
typically considered to be part of moral   foundation's theory although the theory leaves 
itself open to others being found the five moral   foundations Are drum roll please care for example 
looking out for the weak and vulnerable is in   line with this Foundation fairness this could be 
something like giving someone their rights loyalty   
[02:23](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=143) this could be something like patriotism Authority 
for example obeying your leaders and sanctity   which would include things like Chastity now you 
may think that loyalty Authority or sanctity are   not inherent moral goods and I don't either but 
trust me we are going to get into that later   so stay tuned also I should mention that these 
foundations get called a lot of different names   so I'm going with what I view as the simplest 
and most straightforward versions of the names   
[02:57](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=177) moral foundation's theory was originally developed 
by hate and Joseph to explain variations in virtue   Concepts across cultures and eras not variation in 
political ideology but what do you know it turns   out politics has a lot to do with the way people 
think about morality which is why I'm talking   about it here so I should probably mention at this 
point that Jonathan hate who is probably the most   famous person associated with this theory is one 
of the reasons why this theory is a problematic   
[03:28](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=208) fave before anyone accuses me of canceling him 
and he's very concerned with things like that so   this is important I am going to say that I in fact 
encourage you to read his book righteous Minds it   is a great book very well written I was one of the 
first political psychology books I ever read I'm   not even telling you not to spend your money on 
that book but feel free to get from the library or   something I don't think he's desperate for cash my 
first inklings of a problem with hate is something   
[03:58](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=238) I realized near the end of his book where he gets 
very both sides e now in no way am I arguing for   a one party or one ideology State however hate 
seems to argue that liberals and he defines that   to include those on the left of liberals and 
conservatives are moral equals or if anything   that conservatives may be more morally able this 
is a sort of theoretically neat thing the sort of   thing that looks good in a diagram or in a quote 
but does not gel with how the world especially   
[04:36](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=276) America with which he is primarily concerned seems 
to be I will get more into why I disagree with   this take on moral foundations Theory when 
I go more in depth about the theory itself   what is more unfortunate is that he seems to have 
largely spent the year since the publication of   righteous Minds concerned with things like campus 
Free Speech trigger warnings and the problems of   Campus safe spaces can I just say that I went to 
college after he had started writing about this   
[05:06](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=306) stuff and literally never encountered a safe space 
or a trigger warning and I literally studied both   genocide and suicide sometimes in the same week I 
don't know why people think these are everywhere   the only explicit safe spaces I encountered were 
in middle and high school where some teachers had   LGBT safe space stickers up and I think all that 
meant is that those teachers wouldn't let someone   bully someone for being gay or trans and let me 
tell you I had trans friends in high school and   
[05:35](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=335) they still got bullied I should mention that 
I did attend college in Scotland but friends   in the US have had similar experiences to me and 
it's not like no one in Britain is alarmed about   wokeness and such in case you're wondering 
the main reason why I put warnings on parts   of my videos is because one of my videos may have 
literally Auto played after a video of kittens and   I don't feel like randomly slapping someone in the 
face with upsetting topics it feels rude anyway   
[06:04](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=364) I did make myself read hates Atlantic article the 
coddling of the American mind but I could not make   myself read his book by the same title as I find 
these topics deeply tedious he makes some decent   points in the article I also think that we should 
let children play more freely and take more risks   and that certain campus activists are occasionally 
silly and annoying I am not going to pick through   the whole article because I do not run a debate 
Channel and I do not do drama and call outs my   
[06:34](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=394) main point is honestly that focusing on the 
few cherry-picked incidents of cancel culture   or political correctness run amok is a massive 
waste of time and the time of someone like hate is   valuable I know quite a few academics both because 
I work in Academia and because I have family in   Academia as far as I can tell the way this works 
is that one incident of something silly happens at   a university it gets picked up and often distorted 
by a publication a lot of people in Academia read   
[07:05](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=425) like say the New York Times and then they all 
forward the article to each other and end all   all panicky and distracted for a couple weeks 
before the next one comes along these articles   are basically click bait for the intellectually 
influential occasionally an academic will actually   have to deal with someone taking a silly approach 
to activism in a way that affects them or a   University Administration taking an ineffective 
approach to helping marginalized people but I   
[07:33](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=453) find that it is much better to deal with this 
internally rather than by writing sweeping   articles like this one and I want to clarify 
most academics do not write sweeping articles   like this one because they have the good sense 
not to do their office politics in the Atlantic   I do also think that representing what I'm going 
to call Silly approaches to activism as both   a larger threat to intellectual culture than 
they are and more prevalent than they actually   
[08:04](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=484) are undercuts actually important activism and 
even just basic HR practices on campuses and   elsewhere basically I think hate is wasting his 
time and not inconsiderable talents on this and   is probably doing at least some harm by it 
I bet it pays well though hate is also very   concerned with ideological diversity both in 
social psychology and in Academia as a whole   I will fully admit that most social psychologists 
myself included are left of center I actually   
[08:37](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=517) don't object to more right-leaning people getting 
involved it's hard to research right Wingers like   they are literally less likely to answer survey 
questions so basically anything we could do to   help with that would be good however as part 
of this hate seems to take the view that social   psychology should be totally unideological well 
I believe we should Endeavor to be unbiased while   collecting and analyzing data there are a lot of 
Topics in social psychology that are exceedingly   
[09:10](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=550) politically and ideologically fraught if social 
psychology is going to have any real world impact   that impact must be on societal problems that some 
people may not actually believe are problems or in   fact May believe are good things for example you 
could apply social psychology to disenfranchising   minority voters and I would really not want to 
share a department with someone who wanted to   do that however wanting to do that is definitely 
in line with some shockingly common ideologies   
[09:44](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=584) in America should that ideology be 
included and celebrated in Academia   personally I'm gonna go with no I also want to 
mention that I do not want to set an expectation   that I will tell you anywhere near this much 
about the reputation and politics of academics   I cite here typically I do not know that much 
about them except that they wrote a useful and   interesting article in a respected publication the 
only reason I'm doing this with hate is that he   
[10:14](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=614) is enough of a public figure and has made what I 
mentioned before a big part of his public profile   and if he goes full Jordan Peterson I want to be 
on the record about this stuff I was trying to   have that be much shorter but my editor told me I 
had to leave it in so you can take it up with him   anyway back to why moral foundations theory 
is so useful in explaining politics even   though it may not constitute a scientifically or 
philosophically perfect Theory the most useful   
[10:44](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=644) element is definitely the moral pluralism aspect 
but we should probably make sure the other pillars   are not an imminent risk of toppling over before 
we get into that let's start with if political   ideology is innate if it was based on moral 
foundations we would expect it to be for the   innateness element of moral foundation's theory 
to be true people would have to be predisposed to   certain political ideologies but this would not 
mean that experience would not shape political   
[11:12](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=672) ideology Research into genetics suggests that 
predisposition to certain political Tendencies is   highly genetic and in fact I've done a whole video 
about this this heritability is reflected in the   higher levels of political similarity between 
identical twins than between fraternal twins   and siblings one mechanism for the innateness of 
politics could be the enemies of moral Foundation   ends this suggests that political ideology 
is at least somewhat innate and in line with   
[11:39](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=699) moral foundations Theory although interestingly 
while the evidence that political Tendencies may   be linked to genetics is fairly robust there are 
doubts about the heritability of moral foundations   themselves in a study by Smith at all 2017 was 
no significant evidence was found for any of   the moral foundations being heritable this does 
not mean that they are not built on heritable   foundations but wait did I just didn't imply 
foundations of Foundations well I guess that   
[12:10](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=730) could totally be a thing think of like the human 
mind and system of morality like one of those   old cities that has just built on more of itself 
like we can still be born with some scaffolding on   which our later morality can be built without 
the individual foundations being heritable   still further study into the innateness of moral 
foundations as they relate to political ideology   is needed so if not all political differences are 
attributable to genetics and politics vary across   
[12:41](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=761) culture it is at least likely that politics 
are somewhat culturally learned interestingly   this does not appear to be one of the things that 
much of the literature on moral foundations Theory   and political ideology focuses on this might be 
because of cultural learning influences politics   in a way consistent with moral foundations 
Theory it probably does so via cultural values   so basically if moral foundations vary across 
cultures that means that they basically have to   
[13:12](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=792) be culturally learned it's not really something 
that has to be proved separately I'm not sure I'm   explaining this well but basically it's so obvious 
that you don't have to write literature about it   still there is fairly robust evidence people 
have actually bothered collecting that parents   and other authority figures may work to instill 
different values dependent on culture there is   also evidence that where someone is from in the 
world may influence which moral foundations they   
[13:41](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=821) endorse in addition if political ideology is not 
culturally learned but is still based in moral   foundations that are culturally learned then moral 
foundations Theory would still succeed as a theory   of political ideology this suggests that provided 
political ideology is linked to morality it is at   least in part culturally learned so let's move on 
to whether political ideology is consistent with   the intuitionism element of moral foundations 
theory in this context intuitionism would mean   
[14:10](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=850) that political ideologies have a relationship 
to moral foundations that should be measurable   by means which require participants to make 
snap judgments when liberal versus conservative   ideology was measured by an implicit association 
test this implicit ideology predicted agreement   with judgments related to moral foundations 
even more than participants explicitly stated   ideology and Van Luan Park found links between 
endorsement of loyalty Authority and sanctity and   
[14:40](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=880) explicitly and implicitly measured conservatism 
yeah basically we are not all the Deep thinkers   we think we are a lot of it is just after 
the fact justification for staff judgments   however detrimental this might be for political 
discourse it is probably a good thing that we   intuitively know things like murder are 
wrong without having to think too deeply   about it the moral pluralism aspect of moral 
foundations Theory and the associated five   
[15:07](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=907) foundations are the aspect of the theory that 
most researchers in the political realm focus   on this is likely because the possibility of 
multiple and varying moral foundations if it   were true has the potential to explain so much 
of politics like seriously this is so useful   using a variety of measures Graham hate and 
nozick found that liberals and conservatives   in the United States rely on different moral 
foundations and this was true across a variety   
[15:36](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=936) of measures conservatives were found to be 
more likely to draw on the Loyalty Authority   and sanctity foundations while liberals were 
more likely to draw on the care and fairness   foundations similar results were found using data 
from the yourmorals.org test which allowed for the   collection of a larger and more diverse data set 
you can take the your morals test yourself if you   want I will link it below though I would caution 
you against trying to understand your own politics   
[16:03](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=963) based on any kind of test these are typically 
designed for social scientists to understand   the politics of large populations rather than for 
individuals to understand their own politics if   you want to understand this in the context of a 
much worse test you can find on the internet check   out my video on the political Compass I'll link 
that in the corner I actually tried to have the   high school students I was teaching this summer 
do the your morals test but you have to be 18 and   
[16:30](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=990) they did not want to break the rules they were 
really obeying the authority moral Foundation   there I guess I could have used my authority to 
tell them to break the rules but that's usually   something teachers are discouraged from doing 
anyway there is also evidence that ideologies   other than liberal left-leaning and conservative 
have their own Tendencies when it comes to moral   foundations and what they gravitate towards 
he'd had all found that the moral profile of   
[16:59](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1019) people on the religious left include more focus 
on loyalty Authority and sanctity than secular   liberals and higher levels of emphasis on care 
and fairness than social conservatives this is   consistent with the religious left having its own 
political ideology Libertarians have presented a   unique challenge for moral foundations Theory 
Libertarians do seem to have their own moral   profile when measured on the five foundations 
there are low levels of moral concern about   
[17:25](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1045) harm and fairness are similar to conservatives 
and their low levels of concern for the in-group   Loyalty Foundation The Authority foundation and 
the Purity Foundation is similar to liberals   this might prompt people to ask if Libertarians 
are simply less moral iron all propose an   alternative possibility that Libertarians might 
rely on economic and lifestyle Liberties as their   guiding moral principle it is worth noting that 
if this were true it would not disprove moral   
[17:54](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1074) foundation's theory as the theory leaves 
itself open to New Foundations being found   however it may mean that its current form is 
incomplete in terms of explaining political   ideology in terms of my own views on the morals 
of Libertarians and conservatives for that matter   well let's just say that I'll be made clear soon 
moral pluralism is the aspect of moral foundations   theory that is particularly hotly debated 
especially as it relates to political ideology   
[18:24](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1104) I'm going to start with the more scientific 
criticisms and then move on to the more moral   and philosophical ones although I think you might 
be able to guess what some of those are already   one of the main scientific criticisms is the idea 
that there is basically just one moral Foundation   that being that we should not cause harm this 
Falls very neatly under the Care Foundation in   fact this Foundation is often called the care harm 
Foundation Greyhound and weights posit that all   
[18:53](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1133) morality is actually based in perceptions of harm 
they argue that this includes ostensibly harmless   acts like Purity violations such Purity harms 
that do not cause material harm would include   things like the violation of kosher law but also a 
lot of weird hypotheticals that make you say yuck   involving people say interacting with immediate 
relatives and dead chickens but no one being hurt   I genuinely think describing these scenarios may 
get me age restricted so I'm not going to hear   
[19:23](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1163) gray shine and Ward found that ostensibly harmless 
wrongs are still perceived as having victims   activate concepts of harm and increase perceived 
suffering shine and gray extended this argument   to the political realm and argue that there are 
not in fact deep cognitive differences between   liberals and conservatives and then instead they 
view different things as harmful they provide   considerable evidence that harm is in fact Central 
to moral cognition regardless list of politics and   
[19:52](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1192) they also demonstrate that other foundations May 
overlap considerably with harm while it is very   true that different people and cultures likely 
perceive different things as harmful this Theory   does not necessarily account for all morality 
Graham at all rightly point out that this does   not account for things like the role of disgust 
in moral decision making in addition this purely   harm-based morality cannot account for studies 
like those conducted by inbar Bizarro and Cushman   
[20:20](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1220) wherein people were deemed worthy of blame even 
if they were not seen as having actually harmed   anyone in addition there is a chance that people 
may be adjusting their harm perceptions to their   moral foundations or political ideology there 
is also a case to be made that moral foundations   Theory would still help us to understand political 
ideology even if what it posits to be differences   in moral foundations are actually differences in 
what people perceive as harmful as an additional   
[20:47](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1247) criticism coogler Jost and nor Bellucci proposed 
that liberal conservative differences in moral   judgments are mediated by authoritarianism and 
social dominance orientation authoritarianism in   this context is a personality variable meaning 
being highly submissive to authority figures   acting aggressively on behalf of those authorities 
and being traditional and conformist in one's   thoughts and actions social dominance orientation 
is the amount of hierarchy someone wants there to   
[21:14](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1274) be in their society so someone high in Social 
dominance orientation would want to live in a   very hierarchical Society Frederico Weber ergon 
and Hunt did find that the care and fairness   foundations were associated with being low in 
Social dominance orientation and the in-group   authority and Purity foundations were associated 
with right-wing authoritarianism and belief in   a dangerous World belief in a dangerous world is 
exactly what it sounds like by the way I talk way   
[21:42](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1302) more about it in my video on the psychology of 
the gun control debate but I warn you that this   is the second video I ever made and while I stand 
by the research I do not stand by the production   quality anyway back on topic Frederico at all 
see this association between other variables and   the moral foundations as an aspect of moral 
foundations Theory rather than a reason to   discredit it however coogler at all argue that 
the connection of certain moral foundations to   
[22:10](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1330) authoritarianism and social dominance orientation 
does discredit them they argue that conservative   intuitions may have more to do with personality 
Dynamics and ideological differences such as those   linked to authoritarianism and social dominance 
orientation then anything that could be defended   reasonably or successfully as an objective 
moral principle whether personality factors   such as right-wing authoritarianism belief 
in a dangerous world and social dominance   
[22:39](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1359) orientation constitute an alternative to moral 
foundations Theory or something that could be   integrated into moral foundations theory is 
an open question however I think they have   a good point that authoritarianism and high 
social dominance orientation cannot possibly   be defended as moral and that brings me to the 
criticisms of moral foundations on moral grounds question whether moral pluralism and broadening 
the scientific idea of what is moral is a good   
[23:11](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1391) idea I also question this wait this is a YouTube 
video I can say things directly I think a lot of   actions could be in line with the in-group 
authority and Purity foundations while being   extremely immoral cooler at all raise extremely 
valid concerns that the in-group authority and   Purity foundations are associated with integer 
hostility and support for discrimination and I   don't feel the need to listen to anyone who thinks 
Intergroup hostility and discrimination are good   
[23:42](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1422) things in addition differences between liberals 
and conservatives on moral matters is largely   mediated by authoritarianism and social dominance 
orientation both of which are you know like bad   there is also plenty of compelling data to 
indicate that right-wing moral and political   approaches in and of themselves correlate to 
authoritarianism prejudice and discrimination   against members of disadvantaged groups however 
only some academics will out now say that because   
[24:11](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1451) unlike YouTube much of Academia attempts 
political neutrality something I will not   be attempting in this video Hayden Graham two 
researchers key to moral foundations Theory do   argue that the additional moral foundations on 
which conservatives tend to put more emphasis   than liberals should be treated as moral 
instead of amoral immoral or just plain stupid   I think they view this as a sort of sensible 
middle of the road a political take but I   
[24:40](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1480) view it as conceding an honestly dangerous 
amount of ground to the right what I wrote   in the academic essay this video is based on 
is the idea of broadening our understanding   of morality to include these foundations 
is absolutely worthy of debate although   to some extent that debate is more political 
and philosophical than scientific what I was   selling now that is that there are definitely 
some moral foundations or at least aspects of   
[25:06](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1506) foundations that should not be understood 
as morally good I will however argue that   studying something as a moral Foundation does not 
necessarily mean that One Believes it to be moral   for example hanadal used moral foundation's 
theory to better understand terrorist groups   and they never come close to arguing that those 
groups have good morals Hayden Graham argue for   studying a broader form of morality and seeing 
it as valid well Kugler Jost and norbalucci argue   
[25:37](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1537) that treating these broader morals as equally 
valid is dangerous both are essentially treating   moral foundations Theory as if it were a political 
ideology I would argue that moral foundation's   theory can be used as a theory to understand 
political ideologies without becoming one itself   because it is good science but would 
be a pretty shitty political ideology   honestly I think treating it as one makes you 
much more likely to do the tiresome things I   
[26:06](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1566) talked about hate doing earlier and also possibly 
a whole lot worse okay now let's turn down the   heat a bit and talk about whether the theory of 
multiple moral foundations is applicable in a   variety of contexts like any good theory should 
be the generalizability of moral foundations   Theory outside of America and outside of weird 
Western educated industrialized Rich Democratic   populations has long been questioned this is 
a real concern as weird samples tend to be the   
[26:39](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1599) most common samples in social science research I 
should mention the exact meaning of some of the   aspects of weird like Western can be ambiguous but 
going into detail about that is not the point here   also weird is a great acronym possibly my second 
favorite psychology acronym my favorite is BS   I have a whole video about that anyway moral 
foundation's theory was developed partially   in order to account for moral diversity and the 
morality of non-weird peoples and cultures so   
[27:12](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1632) theoretically it should be applicable to political 
ideology in these contexts Kate and Graham gather   data from Canada Western Europe the United Kingdom 
Australia Eastern Europe Latin America South Asia   and the Middle East uh southeast Asia Africa and 
East Asia and they were able to find a correlation   between moral foundations and political ideology 
in every one of these regions Doug gruel Alper and   Yilmaz also tested moral foundation's theory 
in a variety of weird and non-weird cultures   
[27:43](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1663) they found that all five moral foundations 
were present in all 30 societies they tested   while they did find that the levels of 
each Foundation varied across weird and   non-weird cultures this in no way discredits 
the applicability of moral foundations theory   in fact it actually supports the cultural learning 
aspect of the theory now let's talk about if moral   foundations actually cause political ideology 
because loads of things like home decor correlate   
[28:12](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1692) to but don't cause political ideology yeah I'm 
serious about home decor I'll link that study   below anyway the causality element of moral 
foundations theory is like many elements of   the theory not Beyond question hatimi Crabtree 
and Smith have found evidence that ideology May   predict moral intuitions which is the reverse 
of what moral foundation's theory posits in   order to determine whether moral foundations 
or ideology come first they tested whether   
[28:40](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1720) knowing moral convictions at Time 1 allows 
for the prediction of ideology at time two or   three and vice versa their results indicate the 
predictive path runs from ideology to morality   If This Were true moral foundation's theory would 
still have some more limited usefulness because   it would be able to tell us about the morality 
associated with specific political ideologies   all right so is moral foundations Theory a false 
and complete explanation of political ideology   
[29:14](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1754) of course not I said it was a problematic 
fave didn't I there are a number of valid   reasons to be critical of moral foundations 
Theory especially the morale pluralism aspect   many of which I have detailed in the video 
and some of which I did not have room for   but we should ask does moral foundation's theory 
work as a procedure for making sense of these   competing systems of political ideas values and 
opinions to that the answer is a pretty confident   
[29:43](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1783) guess for me since it has been a useful method for 
a number of researchers to understand political   ideology in a variety of conflicts essentially a 
theory does not have to be perfectly correct in   every aspect in order to be at least partially 
successful in order to demonstrate this with   regard to moral foundations Theory and political 
ideology I will explain a few Choice examples of   how it has been used to help better understand 
political ideology moral foundation's theory   
[30:11](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1811) has proven useful in examining how ideologically 
charged political issues are discussed Clifford   and Jarrett have used moral foundations Theory 
to examine moral rhetoric and stem cell research   they were able to find that people on opposite 
sides of the debate on stem cell research have   different patterns of moral rhetoric and lean on 
different moral foundations they found this moral   rhetoric was consequential to the way the public 
thought about the issue meaning that using moral   
[30:37](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1837) foundations Theory allowed them to determine part 
of how the Public's ideological views are shaped   on this issue moral foundations Theory can also 
be usefully applied to political ideologies that   are especially difficult to understand such 
as those of terrorists hanadal were able to   determine that violent extremists right-wing and 
ethno-nationalists and separatist ideologism were   associated with the motivations of loyalty 
Authority and Purity and extremist left-wing   
[31:06](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1866) and single issue ideologies were associated 
with the motivations of care and fairness   I should clarify that all of this research 
was done on specifically violent groups   according to the study's authors this has 
the potential to help us better understand   the motivations of different terrorist 
groups something that prior methods for   understanding terrorism have struggled with they 
also use moral foundations Theory to explore how   
[31:31](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1891) terrorists are morally engaged in spite of the 
heinous acts they commit this is an excellent   example of applying moral foundations Theory 
without implying that just because someone is   operating off moral foundations they are morally 
good moral foundations Theory offers a perhaps   underutilized opportunity to examine the moral 
structures of immoral people and organizations   another useful application of moral foundations 
theory is an adjusting persuasion techniques to   
[32:00](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1920) people with different political ideologies day 
Fisk Downing and Trail found that if issues are   morally framed in line with the moral foundations 
conservatives tend to become more conservative and   liberals tend to become more liberal they also 
found that if liberal issues are framed in terms   of moral foundations typically associated with 
conservatives then conservatives are more likely   to take typically liberal stances interestingly 
the opposite was not true an integral part of   
[32:27](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1947) understanding political ideologies and how they 
are shaped is understanding their relationship to   persuasion and in this study moral foundation's 
theory was able to offer an important Insight   on political persuasion I think the thing to 
understand here is that a moral foundation's   theory allows us to do is to better understand 
those with differing morals than our own however   understanding those morals does not mean that 
they and their Associated ideology should not   
[32:53](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=1973) be examined critically this understanding of the 
morals of more conservative people does not mean   that we should become more conservative or more 
Centrist and in fact offers opportunities to   persuade people towards causes like tolerance 
and combating climate change both of which I   go into more details about in other videos and 
apply moral foundations to basically what I'm   saying is that more oral foundations can be used 
to a become a boring Centrist or B further worthy   
[33:24](https://youtu.be/rwt9F53t7Rs?si=qucpbl_M8nVOU_kT&t=2004) causes and I think you should go with b anyway

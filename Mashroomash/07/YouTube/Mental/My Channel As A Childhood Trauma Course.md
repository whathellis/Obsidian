# Transcript
[00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=1) [Music] so many of you have asked where to start with this channel in terms of learning about childhood trauma and the effects of it because now at this point there's 
[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=16) a lot of videos to dig through and whether you're struggling to afford therapy or you're actually in therapy and need things to bring in or talk about or think about I love hearing from 
[00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=27) you all that this channel is a good resource or you're getting a lot out of it that just like makes my art thing so but instead of being overwhelmed with where to dive in here's what I would 
[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=37) consider is a good sequence of processing and thinking about our childhood Trauma from our family of origin and yes there's a lot of different sources of trauma but this 
[00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=46) channel is really about recovering from an abusive family or off Family system of origin during our crucial development so I'm going to go through step-by-step videos in order to to where kind of like 
[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=59) where everybody should start despite maybe where you're at in your recovery and then add the ones that might be more specific to like some problems that you're having um such as say like things 
[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=70) like anxiety at night anxiety at the morning like that kind of a thing and the best way to use this channel is to take things slow in journal or take notes while you're watching many of the 
[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=80) videos I try to include journaling prompts about inner child work to help process and not just name problems like here's five things you know so I'm told the videos are also kind of dense and 
[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=92) intense someone gave me that feedback about my work is like which kind of made me laugh because it's so true so going too fast might not allow you to take it all in some people have tell me that 
[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=103) they kind of watch the videos a bunch of times and get different ideas from the Ed time if you're new to me or new to the channel welcome if you like this video feel free to hit some buttons on 
[01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=112) the screen you can't miss with any of the buttons especially the like or the Subscribe button which greatly increases the the the breath of like this Channel and creating a community around 
[02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=123) childhood trauma and if these videos are helpful to you in your recovery you can consider supporting the work that goes into this channel over at my patreon and in addition you can go to my website and 
[02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=132) do some childhood trauma ecourse work that I offer there including all the recordings of the webinars that I've done they're all there as well in other exciting news I have two childhood 
[02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=142) trauma groups forming in my practice I have clinicians forming groups in Massachusetts as well as North Carolina they are skilled trainees of mine they're doing their own work um and if 
[02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=153) you're in these states just shoot me an email through my website to connect and ask how to sort of apply for a spot in one of those groups why these specific States well these are trainees and it's 
[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=164) it's specific to lure they have to be practicing in the state that they're getting their license in so I'm sorry that I don't have more resources but there are others listed on my website 
[02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=173) who can also provide childhood trauma Services if you just go to the resources part of the website um and if if you follow this white ball up here takes you right to my website about inquiring 
[03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=185) about those groups or in general let's dive into the sequence on how to use this channel as a childhood trauma like sort of course to learn about it so the first video is something called what I 
[03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=196) was I abused I created a 60 question questioner 30 of them are highlighted in the video and yes you'll most likely score high on that but I think the questions are are more important than 
[03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=207) the scoring because they specifically those questions specifically resonate with childhood Sur survivors in a very specific way I made this video to break up the Paradigm of something called the 
[03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=218) a study which um which kind of excludes the majority of people that went through childhood trauma they only give you a small here's what really what we think childhood trauma is and the benefit here 
[03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=230) is that the questioner and the questions get you really thinking about your family system of origin and the impact of it this video is approaching 2 million views it's also available in 
[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=239) Spanish and French as well you just used the search feature so that's the first video that I would start with it's one of my first videos coming up at number two is a video entitled six unknown 
[04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=248) childhood trauma triggers building on those ideas this video explores what I see as very common issues for childhood trauma survivors it's all stuff that I've learned sort of in my own recovery 
[04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=260) and from the the people who are my clients um things such as ambiguity as being a trigger for us um and this video really gets the viewer to think about about the where and the how our issues 
[04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=272) like being triggered to things like being thoughtless and oblivious people we get triggered to people like that where those specific triggers come from it'll definitely name some things for 
[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=282) you this video is now approaching 2 million views coming in at number three is my seven types of toxic family systems this is really about family systems and thinking about your family 
[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=291) of origin you'll most likely find your family on this I'm using genograms to spell out the different types of families um and you'll most likely find your family on there and many of the 
[05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=302) families overlap so try not to think about it as like where's my specific family you might identify between with four or five of the seven types and they definitely can overlap um this video 
[05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=314) sharpens the lens of connecting the dots between your present stuck places and how you raise this video is approaching a million views there is a follow-up video of contrasting the seven toxic 
[05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=326) family systems with their opposite like seven healthy systems and that will be in the sequence as well moving on to number four a video titled what it means to be triggered a much lesser known 
[05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=336) video done early in the channel it covers specific signs that we're triggered um as I learned them from my mentor what it means for us phys physiologically and how to 
[05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=347) differentiate um between what is the thing going on in the present and what is actually the trigger I talk about something called my 820 rule as a formula to use to get out of being 
[05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=357) triggered faster it's an animated video so you'll kind of get that from the um from the thumbnail and if you're a visual person it's it's it's great and it's rooted in a handout I use for my 
[06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=368) mentor in every group and I kind of all want you to watch that one because it's really about distinguishing your specific triggers having that ability makes everything work better number five 
[06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=378) is a video called six lies from childhood trauma this video explores how beliefs are a direct result of how we were parented and what was modeled for for us so lies such as sex is bad or the 
[06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=392) real you isn't acceptable helps to help us Define some Universal stuck places and answer some big questions this is another connect the dots video connecting issues from our childhood 
[06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=404) trauma um and these are lies these are these are things that are untrue things that we either had to come up with our own or what what we were modeled or what we were directly told um and I want you 
[06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=416) to feel motivated that they are fixable this video is now approaching a million views moving on to number six this is a series of videos that I done it's not just one video these is a series called 
[07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=426) the adult in the inner child episodes I did a series on inner child work called the adult in the inner child episodes the first two episodes really helped Define the concept of what the inner 
[07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=437) child is I talk about Bradshaw there what our inner adult is and how it all works and how they give specific therapy ideas on how working on how to work with our inner child um then the episodes 
[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=450) move into more specific problems such as sort of attachment wounds or anxiety at night um on on and they're done in a specific inner child framework there are lots of exercises and journaling prompts 
[07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=462) in that series here is a list of that of of all the episodes in that series there's the adult and the inner child part one uh episode two as I get into Bradshaw there a continuation of part 
[07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=473) one episode three is the the inner child and attachment Theory um number four is something called my first GI Joe this is a personal story about my own childhood trauma emotional neglect as a teaching 
[08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=485) moment episode five is a love that episode it's a it's a guided inner child meditation on how to connect with our inner child and explore how our inner child feels about us really check that 
[08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=495) one out episode number six is something called anxiety at night then people ask for another episode on that about in the morning so episode seven is anxiety in the morning as requested and episode 8 
[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=506) is around sibling abuse which is an often um I get that request quite a lot so I did a video on The Sibling abuse in context of the whole family system and the inner child um I paused these 
[08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=517) episodes after thinking they might be better served as a podcast you know I get that request sometimes too if you would like to see me do like a one day a week podcast I would I'm working on that 
[08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=526) idea I would love some encouragement if you think that that would be cool for you to kind of take it in in a different way moving on to number seven is a roleplay that I did um between the adult text
[08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=535) and the inner child it's just called inner child roleplay narcissistic parent recovery part one it's a great followup from the episode series that I just mentioned between and it's a role play 
[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=545) between our adult and our inner child High highlighting how the inner adult can behave kind of like our abusive parents and then doing it in a more healthy way a lot of us struggle with 
[09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=557) the idea of the inner child where it's often that the adult doesn't want the job and the inner child doesn't trust the adult and that's what it means to really be disconnected from ourselves so 
[09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=566) highly recommend checking that out there's also a clinical analysis to that role play which is a lot of my role plays about that so I recommend checking them both out they'll be in the sequence 
[09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=576) as well moving on to number eight is a video called the 30-day inner child challenge so in the sequence we're really focusing on the inner child work um this is a month-long exercise it's an 
[09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=586) animated video about becoming aware of how our inner child and our childhood trauma kind of pops up throughout our waking hours pops up through the day um and it's about learning how to be more 
[09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=597) on top of it how to monitor it how to stay more in our adult and you'll need it's a specific tool oriented video so you'll need an object like a stuffed animal or a rock that you're that 
[10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=608) represents your inner child that is with you at all times so there's kind of this take the thing with you at all times and be aware what's going on when you go to work if you do go to work um when you're 
[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=618) at Starbucks when you're your kids parent teacher conferencing all that kind of stuff to notice how it comes up that's what's going on with that video number nine is these are abusive and 
[10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=627) toxic parent role plays so there's a sequence here of a bunch of role plays that I done this might be really the role plays are really what might the channel be might be most known for um 
[10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=638) the role plays are done just like how my mentor Amanda curtain LCSW modeled for them when I was a client in one of her childhood trauma groups um it's done the role plays are done in a sequence of 
[10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=648) different ways so the first part of the role plays is usually um the how we act out how the parent and the child really kind of interact the abusive parent how all that stuff plays itself out 
[10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=659) the second part if we do the same exact thing but what would it be like if the parent was healthy and then the third part is about the adult child becomes empowered and really sort of sets 
[11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=670) boundaries and stands up to the adult which actually kind of triggers a lot of people to be honest but that's what I'm trying to model there you can use those role plays to learn about everything 
[11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=680) from cluster B diagnosis um or really or really seek out the the parental figure you had or what kind of abusive parent you had instead of just being kind of confused these this these videos I think 
[11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=692) people are drawn to it because it really names something for them many of the role plays have a part two to them which is when I do a clinical analysis video about the roleplay that I just did about 
[11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=702) the parents pathology the impact on the children and what's going on for the adult trauma Survivor how they might struggle in relationships because of that parent so I highly highly suggest 
[11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=712) you go check out the clinical analysis videos um they're kind of a lesser known kind of a thing but they're really all those role plays are pretty much done in a part one part two so here's a list of 
[12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=724) the role plays there is the narcissistic mother clinical analysis that follows afterward which is like the first role playay I think I did there's another one number two would be the Amed and 
[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=733) codependent you don't have to watch these in sequence I'm just listing the role plays and mesed and codependent mother daughter with a clinical analysis afterward then there's number three a 
[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=742) malignant narcissistic father clinical analysis afterward there's a covert narcissistic father with a clinical analysis number five is a narcissistic parent and ownership if you ever try to 
[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=754) get a parent to come clean that's the video for you followed up by a clinical analysis number six is a codependent mother um mom is wrapped up in abusive spouse and how that interacts with their 
[12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=766) adult child clinical analysis after that one number seven does one called flying monkeys where the family gangs up on one childhood trauma Survivor with a clinical analysis after that then 
[12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=777) there's number eight which is a gray rod daughter video standing up to a narcissistic parent clinical analysis as well and number nine is um the petulant borderline mother in a clinical analysis 
[13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=788) after that I'm been busy all right so not every cluster b or abusive family parent style is represented there but you'll get the idea about the role plays just 
[13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=800) try not to think about it you need to just watch a couple of them and you'll get the vibe the analysis videos are great if you have lingering questions and why to connect the dots about your 
[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=810) present stuck places and problems from having being raised by such parents and then moving on number 10 is really sort of videos that are about common childhood trauma problems here are 
[13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=819) videos that I've done in attempting to tackle very common and kind of specific problems that are mostly universal to Childhood trauma survivors so you don't have to watch these in sequence of these 
[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=829) problem videos I'm just listing them as as sort of like the ones that you can check out if you want to there's a video called do you Gaslight yourself when we a lot of our inner child is spent really 
[13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=839) second guessing and self-sabotaging that kind of stuff number two is was your other parent narcissistic too people tell me that that was their most important video that they've ever seen 
[14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=848) on this channel cuz it really looks at what about the other parent the Lesser um the seemingly lesser abusive parent we have more work to do with that parent the parent who didn't protect us number 
[14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=859) three is is there cheap Intimacy in your family that's the title where I walk through something called a Cartman drama triangle where there's all kind of triangulation and align in the family 
[14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=869) system think that video is animated as well as the other parent being narcissistic too number four is a a standalone video why are they threatened by your emotions this is a video about 
[14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=881) angry dismissive people in general as well as in our family people who really are threatened by other people's emotions and just do the kaios on the whole thing um you can really feel shut 
[14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=891) out by a person like that and really shamed by a person like that number five is um toxic shame from childhood trauma there's part one that there's part two that actually led to a webinar that's 
[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=901) available on my website cuz I got so much response from that video number six is types of invalidating parents it's a roleplay actually walking through different ways that a toxic parent can 
[15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=913) can have you know act out where their kids really don't see them where their kids really don't feel seen highly recommend checking out that one um number seven is five types of work 
[15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=924) triggers linking how work is a lot like our toxic family systems of origin number eight is childhood trauma and dating it is an animated video about how because of our childhoods Our dating Our 
[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r2fY_dx_hc&t=935) dating radar or our judge of character is really off that's a video on how to work on that number nine is an another animated video as well as the prior one about how to do a family cut off

[00:01](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1) last year i found myself listening to hadestown 
for the first time alone in my room on a brutalist   university campus emptied out by covid i was on 
this bleak empty campus studying social psychology   these experiences isolation 
studying social psychology   and listening to hades town combined in a reaction 
like crystallization and made me realize all the   way down to my core just how weak we are alone and 
how strong we can be together to quote hadestown   
[00:30](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=30) every coward seems courageous in the safety 
of a crowd bravery can be contagious when   the band is playing loud nothing makes a man 
so bold as a woman's smile and a hand to hold   but all alone his blood runs thin and out comes 
doubt comes in i should mention that i'm trying to   have extracts of the music wherever possible but 
that section kept getting copyright claimed so i   had to say it instead of having the music and i've 
had to speed up some of the extracts i'm going to   
[01:01](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=61) put a version with the music in it better up on 
my patreon for patrons to see so that's an extra   incentive to go check that out anyway hadestown 
is actually a really good artistic illustration of   some social psychology phenomena so i'm going to 
reference it throughout the video you don't have   to have seen or heard it for this video to make 
sense but i recommend you check it out at some   point and i'll put a link below where you can hear 
it all for free right here on youtube there'll   
[01:26](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=86) also be some spoilers but most of those are really 
spoilers for a myth that is thousands of years old   when i told him about the concept for this video 
my husband said it's like apes together strong   and i said exactly it's exactly like that we are 
not that different from apes we're evolved to be   social creatures like apes and we're stronger 
together i hinted at before but the other thing   that made me feel the need to make this video 
is covid yeah this video has been a long time   
[01:55](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=115) coming if this video is a plant hades town gave 
it water but the seed for me came even before i   ever heard hadestown on march 15 2020 a date that 
seems a world away a professor of mine along with   one of his colleagues put out an article called 
don't personalize collectivize in this article   they wrote the common sense assumption which is 
reflected in the advice being handed out to the   public is that the way to change behavior is 
to appeal to individual interests to make sure   
[02:24](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=144) people take notice personalize the message change 
your behavior so that you will survive surely   that makes sense well no it is precisely the wrong 
thing to do here's why at a practical level those   leased at risk young fit healthy may well feel 
it isn't worthwhile to make the necessary changes   and so continue acting ways that put the most 
vulnerable old and firm at risk of infection   additionally at a moral level we have the right 
to disregard dangers to ourselves and some even   
[02:54](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=174) glory in being risk takers they might be foolish 
but it isn't disreputable to ignore safety advice   is precisely when people stop thinking in 
terms of i and start thinking in terms of we   more technically when they develop 
a sense of shared social identity   that they start to coordinate support each other 
and ensure that the neediest get the greatest help   sometimes this sense of shared identity emerges 
by the very fact of experiencing a common threat   
[03:19](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=199) but messaging also matters when a threat is 
framed in group rather than individual terms   the public response is more robust and more 
effective the article closes with the phrase   we have to collectivize or we die those 
words have such a sad echo now don't they   so many fell into the trap of individualizing the 
pandemic and so so many of us died every time for   the past two years when i've been told to do what 
i am comfortable with and to be smart and protect   
[03:49](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=229) myself i think back to this article after all i 
am young and fairly healthy i would be unlikely   to die of kovid i just want to do what's best for 
my community but a lot of the time the issue is   phrased so individualistically that i can't even 
figure out what the best thing for my community   is i have been thinking a lot about the dangers 
of hyper-individualization and the goodness that   can be found in groups to the point where i felt 
like i had to make a video about it i promise the   
[04:18](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=258) video won't be all or even mostly about kovid 
i just needed you to understand how i got here   by the way if you're new welcome this is political 
psych with abby i'm abby this channel is about   the psychology of politics and i tend to throw 
in a few jokes i promise this won't all be as   dark as that opening bit i think it's important to 
acknowledge the role psychology itself has played   in the demonization of groups especially crowds 
one of the main historical roots of the psychology   
[04:45](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=285) of groups is gustav labonz the crowd a study of 
the popular mind originally published in 1895.   if you'll direct your eyes to the screen 
you'll see a series of covers from this book   all very unflattering to the concept of the crowd 
this book has a less than positive view of crowds   especially politically radical left wing and 
lower class ones lebon witnessed the paris   commune first hand and let's just say he was not a 
fan he identified strongly with the elite and was   
[05:15](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=315) a nationalist and fervent anti-socialist and at 
least kinda racist and also sexist he even advised   right-wing governments on how to use crowds to 
counter radicals and promote right-wing interests   so while lebanon certainly believed in the power 
of crowds who did not think very highly of them or   the people they contained he believed crowds 
make people irrational violent and mindless   he also believed that crowds erase individual 
identity via a process called submergence   
[05:44](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=344) the submergence thing actually has an 
interesting relationship to haiti's town   in hadestown hades's workers lose 
their identities and even their faces   arguably this is loss of identity in a crowd but 
clearly this loss of identity is because they lose   themselves to their work and lose their ability 
to connect with each other their facelessness   is always in terms of not 
being able to be seen by others   
[06:08](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=368) and not in terms of not being able to recognize 
themselves you can see this in the lyrics it is a bit unclear if they lose their identities 
because they cannot connect to each other or if   they lose connectedness because they lose 
their identities it is probably a bit of   both both these possibilities have parallels 
in social psychology social psychology has   come a long way since the bond and now the 
common and most scientifically supported view   
[06:49](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=409) is that groups and crowds shape the identities 
of individuals but they are also shaped by those   identities and can magnify them and that crowds 
can stand for the interests of those within them   lebon's view did not go unchallenged even early 
on but it was highly influential this led to many   pathologizing the act of gathering crowds to 
advocate for collective interests it is also   important to note that social psychology is mostly 
rooted in trying to explain bad group behavior not   
[07:15](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=435) trying to explain good group behavior the 1930s 
and 40s were boom years for social psychology as   you can guess that's not because those were great 
years for humanity like these are the wikipedia   image collages for those decades they do not 
look fun living through the world wars and then   under the specter of nuclear annihilation really 
gave social psychologists a sense of urgency   since this time was so pivotal to the field 
negative views of group behavior became very   
[07:43](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=463) common if not the default honestly we should 
not blame the scientists of this time for this   they were right the groups have the power to do 
awful things and the negative potential of groups   should be studied in addition we should keep in 
mind that many of these scientists had seen war   first hand and or suffered at the hands 
of authoritarian regimes like the nazis   personal experience often informs scientific 
research especially in terms of what gets studied   
[08:08](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=488) as long as we have a wide variety of personal 
experiences present in the field there is nothing   wrong with that in my view and even if there is 
something wrong with that there's not exactly much   we can do about it a pretty good indication 
of the influence of this time and attitude   is the fact that the illustration on the cover of 
one of my textbooks is guernica a picasso painting   portraying a horrifying bombing carried out by the 
nazis and italian fascists on the orders of franco   
[08:34](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=514) during the spanish civil war in 1937. and no i 
don't know why they printed the painting backwards   on the cover of this textbook comment with your 
possible reason i was talking before about how   many of those who documented and theorized about 
groups were elites who looked down on crowds   however i have to say that especially in the mid 
20th century many of those writing and theorizing   about social psychology had themselves suffered 
at the hands of groups or seen those they loved   
[09:02](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=542) suffer for example stanley milgram was profoundly 
shaped by interactions with his holocaust survivor   relatives it is likely that these experiences led 
to his interest in studying obedience to authority   in the context of atrocities still almost 
all this time there has been an often quieter   and less dramatic discussion of the positive 
effects of groups for example as early as 1898   triplet was doing research that determined people 
through certain tasks better as parts of groups   
[09:30](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=570) i think the really important thing to understand 
is that more than being intrinsically good or evil   what groups are is powerful and this power does 
not negate the power or identity of those in the   group but rather shapes and sometimes magnifies 
it basically what this video is going to argue is   that groups are a powerful tool for change and if 
you think change needs to happen you probably need   a group for that one of the prevailing theories 
for understanding groups and movements is called   
[09:55](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=595) social identity theory basically this theory 
posits that people have identities associated   with groups they belong to people generally want 
good status for the groups they are members of   if they see the status of their group as bad or 
lesser than other groups they have two choices   social mobility and social change a social 
mobility belief structure hinges on the idea   that social barriers are permeable like you can 
pass through them and that you can decouple your   
[10:23](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=623) fate from the fate of your group social mobility 
for individuals is possible but it is often   positioned as more possible than it really is as 
a way of discouraging collective action i will get   much more into that later a social change belief 
structure is predicated on the idea that social   barriers are not permeable for an individual or 
have a very low amount of permeability a social   change belief structure often leads to social 
creativity social creativity is an attempt to   
[10:52](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=652) redefine a group identity so that people can 
essentially feel better about themselves this   can unfortunately include comparisons with groups 
of equal or lesser standing and these comparisons   are often encouraged by dominant groups as a 
way of discouraging challenges to the status quo   what this is is a divide and conquer strategy 
when you add a belief that the status quo   is unjust to a social change ideology you get 
cognitive alternatives and social competition   
[11:20](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=680) cognitive alternatives are a road map for social 
change and an ideology critical of the status quo   social competition is competition with another 
group over status this can be anything from a   debate to a protest to an all-out war i should 
mention that a lower status group engaging in   successful social competition with a dominant 
group won't necessarily make life worse for   members of the dominant group it would just take 
away a portion of that dominant group's dominance   
[11:46](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=706) like women getting the vote did not make the 
world worse for men it just took away a portion   of their dominance over women if you happen to 
think women voting was a bad thing for men i   suggest you leave now because i am successfully 
stealing your masculine potency with my jewess   magic and if you stay any longer i will take more 
of it you have been warned anyway back to social   psychology one really important element of this is 
that separating someone from a group is a way to   
[12:21](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=741) severely limit their ability to change the system 
making them believe in social mobility really   strongly basically if they leave behind collective 
identity they can make it on their own is a really   effective way to do that perhaps the most obvious 
example here is economic if someone believes that   they'll be rich someday they are less likely to 
advocate for an equality-oriented society or like   get out the guillotines i would like to assert 
that i am for the former but do not currently   
[12:47](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=767) favor the latter what is sort of odd is that these 
beliefs about social mobility tend to translate   into abstract beliefs about society rather than 
support for specific policies for example a   study across five countries found that belief in 
social mobility was largely unrelated from views   on estate taxes although i will say that a lot 
of people just don't have strong opinions on or   understanding of things like estate tax this same 
study also examined specific income inequality   
[13:14](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=794) policies like increasing taxes on top earners and 
found that while lower social mobility beliefs   correlated with the support for specific income 
tax policies this pattern was limited to moderate   to strong liberal respondents and was not found 
in some countries so basically social mobility   beliefs do connect to people's willingness to take 
action on economic issues but the connection to   specific policies is far from one to one i should 
also say that a belief in individual mobility   
[13:41](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=821) is not all bad for example a belief in social 
mobility may help motivate someone to take actions   to improve their lot in life and these actions 
can sometimes be helpful for the individual   even if they take place within an unfair system 
in addition feeling like you as an individual   can't progress at all is just a shitty feeling i 
think the hard thing is finding the right balance   between one's individual responsibility and the 
need for collective action in an unfair society   
[14:08](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=848) unfortunately there are a lot of people willing to 
take advantage of that tension for their own ends   a lot of people are also willing to take advantage 
of social creativity in encouraging oppressed   groups to compare themselves to groups with equal 
or lesser standing this also divides those groups   and keeps them from standing in solidarity against 
oppression and for a better life for themselves   basically if someone wants to stop collective 
action they want people as separated as possible   
[14:36](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=876) they want to separate individuals and groups 
from each other or in the far more poetic words   of hades town why build walls make folks walk 
single file divide and conquers what it's called   let's start with making folks walk single file or 
how often false perceptions of individual social   mobility undermine collective action there's 
definitely a reason that multi-level marketing   schemes talk about being your own boss and taking 
control of your life and there's definitely also a   
[15:04](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=904) reason they heavily target women and other people 
marginalized from the mainstream business world   i can't prove that the reason that corporations 
and to some extent even governments and political   parties push individualistic girl boss feminism 
is that it's less challenging to the status quo   but this sort of quote unquote feminism focused 
on individual advancement within the existing   system does not really seem to be creating 
a lot of systemic change and we do see over   
[15:31](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=931) and over that women can exploit others in a very 
similar way to the way that they are exploited by   men i am certainly not arguing for womanhood to 
be ignored as an identity for organizing around   what i'm instead saying is that working for 
your own individual advancement as a woman is   not the same thing as fighting for women 
as a group or dismantling the patriarchy   having more women in positions of power if those 
women are committed to women's rights is good   
[15:55](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=955) but that is more being a leader within 
collective action than it is individual   social mobility i should also say that women 
and other people from marginalized groups trying   to get ahead as individuals is not bad it's 
just maybe not the route to systemic change   in addition this sort of individual mobility 
can be tied to tokenism tokenism is when some   limited number of people from a disadvantaged 
group can pass through societal barriers   
[16:20](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=980) but those barriers still exist obviously the main 
problem with tokenism is that these barriers exist   but there is also the problem that tokenism makes 
it much harder to detect and overcome these mostly   but not totally impermeable barriers tokenism 
is likely to decrease collective action because   it makes it harder to see the necessity of it 
like in hades town how hades lets orpheus try to   leave so that his workers do not realize the full 
extent of their own oppression and overthrow hades   
[16:48](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1008) the good news is that in a series of experiments 
on tokenism wright found some ways to encourage   collective action in spite of tokenism if it is 
made clear that the tokenism is illegitimate then   collective action is more likely to occur in other 
words if people actually understand that more   people from their group deserve something than are 
allowed to get it they're more likely to act in   addition if someone from the dominant group points 
out the tokenism system is illegitimate and unjust   
[17:15](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1035) that is also likely to increase collective action 
this over individualized perspective also extends   to messaging about the environment i should 
mention that extending social identity theory to   something like environmental issues is still valid 
because values and political inclinations can be   an identity however social identity theory may 
not translate as smoothly to issues like climate   change that affect everyone maybe the fact that 
climate change affects everyone is part of why   
[17:42](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1062) efforts to make us conceptualize the issue 
individually have been so successful the concept   of the personal carbon footprint was invented 
by pr people from bp yes british petroleum bp   understood that we are unable to stand up to 
systemic issues like climate change as individuals   before bp used this idea messaging about littering 
was coming from the companies that made the sort   of packaging people littered these big polluting 
companies want to blame us for their unsustainable   
[18:11](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1091) practices my mom always says fix the problem not 
the blame but here big companies are trying to   fix the blame on us so we can't fix the problem 
your personal consumption habits simply cannot   end climate change i went through a climate change 
protest a few months ago that was focused around   getting the federal reserve to enact necessary 
environmental policies like ending financing of   fossil fuels and encouraging the financing 
of sustainable organizations and businesses   
[18:38](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1118) at the protest i got into a conversation with a 
woman who was mad that some teenagers attending   the protest had brought along a wagon full 
of snacks and drinks in plastic packaging   i should clarify she was not angry at the 
companies that have forced plastic to be so   pervasive in our lives or the government for 
failing to sufficiently regulate packaging   she was mad at these teenagers who had shown up 
in the rain to a climate protest and had been   
[19:04](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1144) nice enough to bring snacks now i'm not going to 
say that this was all that woman's fault but she   was certainly doing what fossil fuel and plastic 
companies would like her to do in that scenario   trying to live in a more sustainable way isn't 
bad it just isn't enough and can be a distraction   we did not create our unsustainable lives we 
were dropped into them our ability to make   more sustainable choices is largely shaped by the 
system in which we live in order to change those   
[19:34](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1174) systems we need to act as a group for example 
i don't drive and i mostly take the bus to get   around in order to do that i need the government 
to provide bus service which i should clarify   i still pay for both per ride and via my taxes 
sometimes i take lyft or uber if i need to get   somewhere quickly or somewhere the bus does not 
go i don't really have much of a choice but if i   work with those around me to lobby for better bus 
service maybe i can have that choice in the future   
[20:02](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1202) and here's the beautiful thing if we make that 
choice sufficiently cheaper or easier people   who don't give a [ __ ] about the environment will 
take that choice too to quote bill mckibben let's   assume generously that five percent of americans 
are deeply concerned about climate change   concerned enough that they will change all their 
light bulbs scrimp and safe to put a solar thermal   hot water system on the roof or really scrimp and 
safe to put some photovoltaic electricity up there   
[20:31](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1231) unplug all their vampire appliances when not 
in use cut the number of car trips they make   in half and use a hybrid for the remaining 
journeys buy only local food in season   use a clothesline to dry their clothes 
whenever the temperature tops 50 degrees   that's 1016 pounds of carbon saved right there cut 
their air travel by two-thirds and learn to enjoy   the pleasure of staycations take showers with an 
egg timer so that they don't stay under too long   
[21:01](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1261) 350 pounds of carbon and do all the other things 
that every website recommends for reducing your   carbon footprint and then let's assume that they 
go by offsets for the rest from a company like   native energy which will use the money to build 
windmills on indian reservations okay add it up   carry the one dummy here we go yes the impact 
on the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is   zero okay not precisely zero every little bit 
helps i think that number might be more than five   
[21:39](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1299) percent by now but this article is from around 
2008. the point still stands though the good   news is five percent of people is more than enough 
for a political movement and political movements   can change the way everyone lives also by changing 
the way everyone lives i absolutely do not mean by   making people's lives more dreary or more limited 
a lot of things that make life more sustainable   also make it better or healthier a lot of 
this is about making the more sustainable   
[22:07](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1327) choice systemically easier or better and you know 
i think a lot of people would like more trees in   their neighborhood or better train service even if 
they aren't thinking of it in environmental terms   i also think it's important to mention that 
by shaping how non-environmentalists live   environmentalists are not taking away their 
freedom in the absence of collective movements   power does not flow to all individuals 
but rather to certain already powerful   
[22:31](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1351) individuals and to corporations we can take 
this power back but we have to do it together   in addition to mass political movements individual 
actions are also more impactful in social context   like when someone puts up solar panels 
their neighbor is more likely to do so   basically that peer pressure thing 
they warned you about in health class   can be good actually although yet again and i'm 
just thinking of this as i'm recording the video   
[22:57](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1377) it is really important not to focus too much on 
like the individual actions of climate activists   and a lot of the time people who are opposed to 
the environmental movement really want you to do   that one environmental activist taking like one 
flight in coach does not negate their activism   of course a choice like solar panels is not 
available to or practical for everyone for example   i live in an apartment and not on the top floor 
so i have neither legal control over my dwelling   
[23:27](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1407) or a roof hell i don't even have access to 
recycling and i'm luckier than a lot of others   in terms of the choices open to me basically 
we can sometimes make better individual choices   and pressure others to do so but we need 
to work collectively to make those choices   open to more people as well as cheaper and easier 
still it's not really about individual choices   the choices open to us in our current system 
simply won't cut it and even if we had more   
[23:56](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1436) choices that is not necessarily the best way to 
approach things it's great if you can choose solar   power for your house and i'm all for making that 
an easier choice but what's much better is having   your whole city or country powered by sustainable 
energy i think now we can see why hades would   make orpheus and eurydice walk single file out 
of the underworld if he wanted orpheus to fail   being or feeling alone weakens us or to 
quote hades referring to orpheus and eurydice 
[24:25](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1465) the undersigned shall not turn to look behind 
she's out of sight and he's out of his mind   okay now that we've talked about making folks 
walk single file let's talk about building walls   between them i want to clarify here i am mostly 
talking about metaphorical walls although this   does have a relationship with certain real 
walls within the social identity framework   that i'm talking about there is a form of social 
creativity that involves comparison with groups   
[24:58](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1498) of lower equal social standing these comparisons 
can decrease the likelihood of collective action   and sometimes serve the interests of 
a group higher in a social hierarchy   in haiti's town this can be seen in the 
way in which hades encourages his workers   to view those beyond the wall calling them 
the enemy and equating them with poverty   he also encourages the workers to see themselves 
as luckier than those beyond the wall and to see   
[25:22](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1522) him as benevolent here are some lyrics between 
hades and the workers to illustrate what i mean   calls we have and they have not my children 
my children because they want what we have got because they want what we have i can see a lot of examples of this specific 
form of social creativity leading to conflict   between oppressed groups often with one or 
more press groups siding with the oppressor   
[26:01](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1561) there are a lot of historical and modern day 
examples i could go into here but i don't want   this video to be too long so i'm just going 
to focus on a few permutations of one example   so let's talk about how racism against 
african americans has been used as a tool   for keeping people from addressing economic 
inequality even economic inequality between   white people in america before i get into this i 
do want to say that racism has clearly had much   
[26:28](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1588) worse effects on african americans than it has 
had on economically disadvantaged white people   it is in no way my intention here to 
make the fight against racism about   white people i also fully admit that white 
privilege is a thing that i mostly have   to clarify i'm european jewish so i mostly get 
white privilege but certain very specific types   of racists don't think i'm white and also hate me 
anyway back on topic basically my main point here   
[26:58](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1618) is by encouraging poorer white people to compare 
their status to african americans and by sowing   division between these groups richer white people 
have been able to keep both these groups in a more   subordinate position i am cribbing most of this 
from the work of heather mcgee and specifically a   great npr interview she did in 2021 so if you want 
to learn more i will link that below mcgee makes   the point that in the south before integration a 
very small amount of rich white people held nearly   
[27:26](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1646) all the power and wealth and did not have to offer 
much of it to the other white people in the area   to get their support they just had to promise 
to maintain racial hierarchy essentially they   encouraged poorer whites to compare themselves to 
black people and to focus on staying above them   rather than to compare themselves to rich whites 
and try to actually better their lot in life via   collective action a very similar phenomena can 
be seen in the reagan era with less wealthy white   
[27:50](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1670) people being convinced to vote against programs 
that would help them on racist grounds to quote   mcgee what the rate was able to say you know the 
government's no longer on your side it's on the   side of these undeserving people of color these 
people you've been taught to distrust and disdain   and so you should trust the market right 
turn to the market turn to individualism   turn to the wealthy for your you know sense of 
identity and trust and your sense of how you're   
[28:15](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1695) going to succeed in life right it's no longer 
going to be the new deal universal benefits   the wright was able to persuade people to 
focus more on maintaining their place in an   unjust hierarchy than working to dismantle 
that hierarchy and that to me at least is   tragic unfortunately strategies like this 
persist today and meet with frequent success   for an example look at discussions around 
healthcare or welfare in america it's a sad song 
[28:47](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1727) it's a sad tale it's a tragedy haiti's town ends in tragedy but 
i don't want this video to so i want to tell you   one of many inspiring stories about solidarity 
this story is the basis for the 2014 movie pride   pride is about solidarity between striking 
welsh miners and gay people in the 1980s   i first encountered it in a social psychology 
class i took in undergrad actually i only got   
[29:16](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1756) to see about half of it then because i had 
a scheduling conflict and then i got lost   i'm convinced the psychology building at my old 
university was a maze on purpose and they were   using it to run experiments anyway a while later 
i got to see the whole thing i think i've now   seen it about three and a half times partially 
because my husband is both a british leftist and   an enormous sap so it's one of his favorite movies 
anyway spoilers for the movie that are actually   
[29:42](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1782) spoilers for 80s british history basically in 
the movie and in reality a bunch of gays and   lesbians decided to support striking coal miners 
to quote mark ashton one of the founders of lgsm   lesbians and gays support the minors one 
community should give solidarity to another   it is really illogical to say i'm gay and i'm into 
defending the gay community but i don't care about   anything else in addition a lot of lgsm members 
and those in mining communities felt camaraderie   
[30:12](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1812) due to their shared mistreatment by the police 
media and government the meyer strikes were not   really successful but the solidarity formed during 
that time really helped out the gays and lesbians   in the long term to quote jonathan blake an lgsm 
activist with the south wales miners at the 1985   labor party conference we put gay rights on the 
agenda the resulting equality resolution became   the trajectory that would lead to civil 
partnerships and marriages then yem didn't   
[30:38](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1838) want anything to do poops but died donovan put 
pressure on them he was as good as his word it   is really important to note that lgsm did not 
go into it thinking that they would personally   get anything out of it they were trying to 
help others and they were helped in return   okay so what's the point of this video well 
i guess the point i'm trying to make is that   togetherness and solidarity isn't wishy-washy 
hippie stuff it's power and to a large extent you   
[31:03](https://youtu.be/mE617qHso6k?si=o47nyPsIejRHGCwb&t=1863) can prove that scientifically and with historical 
examples individually we are small and weak and   easily taken advantage of that's why those opposed 
to systemic change on issues like inequality and   climate change encourage us to think and act only 
as individuals while we absolutely can be taken   advantage of as parts of groups forming groups and 
alliances between groups is a key way to improve   things for ourselves and others as well as the 
only way to affect things at scale thank you so

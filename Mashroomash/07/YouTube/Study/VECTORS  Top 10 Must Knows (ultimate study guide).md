[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=0) here are the top 10 most important things you need to know about vectors must know number one what is a vector let me start by explaining to you the difference between a scalar and a 
[00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=16) vector quantity a scaler is a quantity that has magnitude only examples of scalar quantities are things such as temperature mass volume and speed on the other hand a vector is a quantity with 
[00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=31) both magnitude and Direction examples of vector quantities are Velocity displacement and any Force including the force of gravity now let me show you how we represent vectors vectors are 
[00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=44) represented as directed line segments and there are a couple different ways to name this Vector we could choose a letter I'll choose the letter V and then put a vector symbol above it or we could 
[00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=56) choose a letter for the start of the vector and the start of the vector we call the tail I'll choose the letter A for the tail of the vector and put another letter at where the vector 
[01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=65) finishes at the tip of the vector I'll choose the letter b and because this Vector starts at a and finishes at B we could Define this as the vector a b and then put a vector symbol above those two 
[01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=79) letters that communicates that we have a vector that starts at a and finishes at B now this Vector has both a magnitude and a direction its magnitude ude is represented just by the length of this 
[01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=92) line and if you put vertical lines around the name of the vector that means the magnitude of the vector the direction of this Vector is communicated by the arrow that's at the tip of the 
[01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=103) vector that shows what direction it's going in and there are a couple different ways to communicate the magnitude and direction of a vector let's say this Vector represents a 
[01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=111) velocity we could say that the magnitude of this velocity is let's say 10 km an hour and we would have to give it a direction we can give it a direction based on its quadrant bearing I could 
[02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=122) say that it is north 37° towards East that means it's moving towards north but moving 37° towards East now this isn't the only way to 
[02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=135) define both the magnitude and direction of a vector to describe how to get from the tail to the tip of a vector we could instead break the vector into its horizontal and vertical components by 
[02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=147) doing that we get a vector in what's called component form and we call that type of vector a cartisian or algebraic Vector let me make up a new Vector I'll call it Vector U so I can show you what 
[02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=158) component form looks like inside of square brackets I write a horizontal and vertical component of a vector so the five is the horizontal or X component of this Vector U and the two is the 
[02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=171) vertical or Y component of this Vector to graph this Vector on a cartisian grid I choose a starting point I'll choose right here at the point 2 two and then to get from that point to the tip of the 
[03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=182) vector I have to move five units in the x or horizontal Direction and then two units in the y or vertical Direction and that would bring me to the tip of the vector right there and then this Vector 
[03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=194) U could be translated anywhere on the cartisian grid as long as I keep its magnitude and Direction the same so what's commonly done is it's drawn in what's called standard position and that 
[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=203) means it's drawn so that its tail is right at the origin of the cartisian grid and we do that because if we look at the coordinates of where the tip of the vector is it's at the point 5 2 
[03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=215) notice those coordinates exactly match the X and Y components of my vector and then if I wanted the magnitude of this Vector U if I were to label the horizontal and vertical components of 
[03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=226) this Vector you would see that what we have here is a right angle triangle so to find the magnitude of vector U I know that 5^2 + 2^2 would equal the magnitude of u^2 based on Pagan theorem and if I 
[03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=239) rearrange that I would know that the magnitude of U equals the &lt; TK of 5^ 2 + 2^ 2 which is equal to the &lt; TK of 29 and it might be useful if I give you a generalized formula for the magnitude of 
[04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=252) any Vector let's say we have Vector U and we want its magnitude what we do based on Pythagorean theorem is we do the square root of the X component squared plus the Y component squared let 
[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=264) me make up one more Vector to try this all out let's say we have another Vector I'll call it vector k K and it's the vector --2 -4 to draw this Vector I could draw in standard position by 
[04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=276) putting its tail at the origin and making the tip go to the point -24 and then if I wanted the magnitude of this Vector if I follow my magnitude formula I just have to do the square root of the 
[04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=287) X component squar plus the Y component squar so that would be the square root of 20 which would simplify to 2un 5 must know number two vector addition let me start by showing you how to add two 
[05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=306) vectors geometrically and then I'll show you algebraically after let's say we're given two geometric vectors I'll draw directed line segments for Vector a and Vector B let's say our goal is to find 
[05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=318) what Vector a plus Vector B looks like the sum of two vectors is called the resultant vector and that just means we want to find the net displacement caused by these two vectors 
[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=330) and to visualize that what we need to do is reposition these vectors without changing their magnitude or Direction so that they're placed tip to tail so I'm going to move Vector a and Vector B so 
[05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=342) that the tail of B is at the tip of vector a and I'll Center this and now that they're positioned tip to tail to find the resultant or the net displacement caused by these two vectors 
[05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=353) I draw a vector that goes from the tail of my first Vector up to the tip of my second Vector so this is Vector a plus Vector B whether someone went from the start to here and then from there to 
[06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=367) there or if they started here and just went straight up to here you would have the same net displacement that's why this blue Vector represents the sum of vector a and Vector B and now let me 
[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=379) show you how to add vectors algebraically let me give you two vectors in component form let's say we have Vector a which is the vector 13 and Vector B which is the vector 22 to add 
[06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=391) these vectors algebraically all I actually have to do to find Vector a plus Vector B my resultant is going to be a vector that has both an X and A Y component to get the X component of my 
[06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=405) resultant I just add the X component of vector a with the X component of vector B and to get the Y component of my resultant add the Y component of a with the Y component of b so when adding the 
[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=418) X components that would be 1 + 2 and when adding the Y components of the vectors that would just be 3 + 2 which gives us a resultant Vector of 35 now let me show you on this cartisian grid 
[07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=432) why that works if I were to draw Vector a which is the vector 13 and to draw Vector B which is the vector 22 now when adding vectors they have to be placed tip to tail so let me take this Vector B 
[07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=443) and reposition it so that its tail is at the tip of vector a and I know the resultant would go from the tail of the first first Vector to the tip of the second Vector I notice the tip of this 
[07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=452) Vector is at the point 35 which corresponds to our answer here and it should be easy to see why that works let me zoom in a little bit the X component of my resultant we know is 
[07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=463) three and the Y component is 5 this three is just a sum of the X components of vector a and Vector B here's the X component of a and here's the X component of b notice combining those 
[07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=477) together gets me the X component of my resultant vector and then also here's the Y component of a and here's the Y component of b combining those together you can see that that corresponds to the 
[08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=490) Y component of my resultant Vector must know number three Vector subtraction let's say we're given two geometric vectors vectors A and Vector B let me show you how we can draw what 
[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=506) Vector a minus Vector B looks like there are two two main ways to do this method one is by using your knowledge of vector addition to add the opposite of vector B and what I mean by that is if we're 
[08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=518) interested in what Vector a minus Vector B is equal to algebraically you would know that that would be the same thing as doing Vector a plus the negative of vector B adding a negative is the same 
[08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=531) as subtracting and we know how to do vector addition we reposition them tip to tail and then draw the resultant of the two so let me draw Vector a a and the negative of vector B tip to tail so 
[09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=542) I'll redraw Vector a by keeping its magnitude and Direction the same and to that Vector I have to add the negative of vector B well the negative of vector B would have the exact same magnitude 
[09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=553) but would be going in the exact opposite direction so I'll take this Vector B and I'll switch it to the negative of vector B by putting the arrow at the other end of the vector and now this is the 
[09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=564) negative of vector B so if I want to add those two vectors together I just have to position them to tail and I know the resultant Vector is going to go from the tail of the first Vector to the tip of 
[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=574) the second Vector so there's what Vector a minus Vector B looks like the other method for getting this exact same Vector is rearranging our problem into an addition problem and we use the 
[09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=585) triangle law for this now I know if I want Vector a minus Vector B that's going to result in a new Vector I'll call that new vector vector C and then rearranging this equation to isolate a I 
[09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=598) can move this to the other side to make it plus Vector B I get Vector a is equal to Vector B plus Vector C this will all make sense once I take these two vectors and reposition them so they're tail to 
[10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=612) tail with each other this statement says that Vector a is a sum of vector B and Vector C well that would mean that Vector B plus some other Vector would equal vector a so 
[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=626) I'll draw that other vector and call it vector C right Vector B and Vector C are tipto tail with each other and the resultant of those two vectors is supposed to be Vector a but remember 
[10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=639) this Vector C is actually equal to what Vector a minus B is and if we compare these two vectors this one and this one you'll notice they have the exact same magnitude and Direction now to use this 
[10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=651) method there's actually a shortcut we don't have to do this rearranging algebraically each time to subtract two vectors you just place them tail to tail and I know the difference of those two 
[11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=661) vectors will connect the tips of the two vectors and because we're doing a minus B the first Vector in the subtraction is a so Vector a minus B will have its tip pointing at the tip of vector a now that 
[11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=673) you know how to subtract vectors geometrically let me show you algebraically how we subtract vectors so I'm going to move this over a bit and let's say you are given two algebraic 
[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=682) vectors Vector a is 63 and Vector B is 4 -2 that musts determine what Vector a minus Vector B is if I want to do Vector a minus Vector B algebraically I know my result is going to have an X and A Y 
[11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=697) component to get the X component I do the X component of a minus the X component of b and same thing for the Y components the Y component of a minus the Y component of b so applying that to 
[11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=710) this question Vector a minus Vector B let me just rewrite the vectors in this subtraction so that's the vector 63 minus the vector 4 -2 and then to get this Vector a minus B 
[12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=722) to get the X component I just do 6 - 4 and to get the Y component I just do 3 - -2 which that would simplify to the vector 2 5 must know number four scalar 
[12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=742) multiplication for this let's look at what happens if we were to take some vector and multiply it by a scalar so let's say we have K * Vector a but multiplying a vector by a scalar it 
[12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=754) might get longer or shorter depending on the value of K but the result will always be a vector that's parallel to the original Vector either in the same direction or the exact opposite 
[12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=764) direction if K is bigger than zero then K * Vector a is going to be in the same direction as Vector a and with a magnitude equal to K * the magnitude of a but if K is less than zero so if it's 
[12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=778) negative K * Vector a is in the opposite direction as Vector a and its magnitude is equal to the absolute value of K * the magnitude of a and the best way for me to clarify what this all means to you 
[13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=791) is with an example so let's say we have some vector vector U that is pointed straight up to the north and its magnitude is 10 km an hour let's draw what negative Vector u a half * Vector U 
[13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=804) and negative a half * Vector U look like so let me start by drawing Vector U if I want to draw a negative Vector U that means the criteria of the scalar being less than zero our scalar multiple this 
[13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=816) time is ne1 so negative U is going to be in the opposite direction as Vector U and its magnitude is equal to the absolute value of K well the absolute value of1 is 1 times the magnitude of a 
[13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=829) so its magnitude is just being multiplied by 1 so the magnitude is not changing but it will be going in the opposite direction so this is the negative of vector U it's 10 km an hour 
[14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=841) south a half times Vector U well that has a positive scalar so it's going to be in the same direction and its magnitude is going to be a half times the magnitude of the original Vector 
[14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=854) which means instead of 10 km hour north it's going to be 5 km hour north so I need to draw a vector that is half as long but pointing in the same direction and lastly negative a half U 
[14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=866) is going to just be the exact opposite of a half U so it's going to have the same magnitude as a half U but in the opposite direction which means it's going to be going 5 km an hour south so 
[14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=876) hopefully you can see how scalar multiplication works let me show you algebraically how we can do it as well so let's look over at this cartisian grid now let's say we're given Vector a 
[14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=886) in component form is the vector 2 3 Let's determine what 2 * Vector a is algebraically this calculation is quite easy 2 * Vector a would just be 2 * the vector 2 3 and to do that calculation 
[15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=901) algebraically we just have to multiply both of the components of the vector by the scalar that's in front of the vector so this would equal I multiply the X component by two which is four and I 
[15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=913) also multiply the Y component by two which is six and now let me show you on this cartisian grid how Vector a and 2 * Vector a compare to each other so if I were to draw Vector a I'll start its 
[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=925) tail at the origin and put the tip at the point 2 3 and drawing two times Vector a its tail is at the origin and the tip is at the point 46 notice both vectors are going in the same direction 
[15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=935) that's because the scalar is positive and 2 * Vector a is double the length of vector a now one useful application of scalar multiplication of a vector is creating something called a unit Vector 
[15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=949) so I could create unit Vector a and I could communicate that by putting this little hat above a that means unit Vector a which means a vector that goes in the exact same direction as a but it 
[16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=962) only has a magnitude of one unit so how could we shrink this Vector so its magnitude is only one unit well we just have to multiply that vector by one over its own magnitude and if I want the 
[16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=974) magnitude of a I know it would be equal to the square root of the X component squar plus the Y component squar so 2^ 2 + 3^ 2 is 13 so the magnitude is the sare &lt; TK of 13 If I multiply that by 
[16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=988) vector a what this scalar does to this Vector is it shrinks its magnitude down to a magnitude of one but it keeps it going in the same direction if I were to multiply both of these components by 1/ 
[16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1000) &lt; tk3 the approximate values of that are 055 and 83 if I were to draw that Vector let me zoom in it would be this Vector right here it's in the same direction as a but it's length is only one unit 
[17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1020) must know number five dot product dot product is the first of two special products you can find with vectors dot product is sometimes referred to as a scalar product and that's because the 
[17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1031) result of a DOT product is always going to be a scalar let's say we're given two vectors Vector a and Vector B the dot product of these two vectors is the product of the magnitude of one of the 
[17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1042) vectors we'll say Vector B with the magnitude of the part of vector a that is app in the same direction as Vector B so let me show you the formula that does this product a do B based on the 
[17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1057) definition is a product of two things the magnitude of one of the vectors we chose Vector B so I need to do the magnitude of vector B and multiply that by the magnitude of the part of vector a 
[17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1070) that is applied in the same direction as Vector B to visualize that let me break up Vector a into two vectors one vector that's par parallel to Vector B and one vector that's perpendicular to Vector B 
[18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1082) now we actually only want this one that's parallel to Vector B so let me erase this other one but I'll put a dotted line where it was so you can remember how we created this bottom 
[18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1093) vector and there's going to be a 90° angle between those lines this Vector down here that shows the part of a that's going in the same direction as B we have a name for that Vector let me 
[18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1104) zoom in a bit that Vector is called the projection of Vector a onto Vector B So based on the dot product definition I need to multiply the magnetude of vector B by the magnitude of the projection of 
[18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1120) a onto B and if we know this angle between Vector a and Vector B and we know trigonometry we should be able to come up with an expression for the magnitude of that projection so if I 
[18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1132) want the length of this side of this right triangle I can just use soaa I know that cosine of this angle would equal the magnitude of the adjacent side divided by the magnitude of the 
[19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1144) hypotenuse and then rearranging this to isolate the magnitude of the projection that would be equal to the magnitude of a * cosine of theta so in my dotproduct formula I can replace this magnitude 
[19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1155) with the magnitude of a * cos Theta and that's the dot product formula for if we have geometric vectors where we know both of their magnitudes and the angle between the two vectors if we're given 
[19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1166) the vectors in component form so for for given algebraic vectors the formula for finding the dot product is to just multiply their X components plus multiply their y components so those are 
[19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1179) the two formulas and you can decide which one to use based on whether you have geometric or algebraic vectors I should mention one more thing we know that dot product is a scalar product 
[19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1190) that scalar product will sometimes be positive sometimes negative and sometimes will actually be zero and that will all depend on the angle between the vectors if the angle between the vectors 
[20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1202) is less than 90° like in the diagram that I have here well I know cosine of an angle less than 90 is positive so the dotproduct will be positive if the angle between the 
[20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1213) vectors is bigger than 90 let me actually just do a rough sketch of what that would look like cosine of an angle between 90 and 180 is negative so I know the dot product in this situation would 
[20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1225) be negative another way to understand why the DOT product is negative when the angle is bigger than 90 is because if I were to draw the projection of a on to B in this scenario notice it would be 
[20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1235) going in the opposite direction of vector B and the third and final scenario is if the angle is equal to 90° if the angle is equal to 90° we'll be doing cosine of 90 which is zero which 
[20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1248) means the dot product is going to be zero and if I were to draw two vectors that have an angle of 90° between them if I were to try and draw the projection of a onto B I wouldn't be able to to 
[20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1258) draw a vector that has any magnitude it would just be the zero Vector which means that this product would become zero let me now do two quick examples of calculating a DOT product let's look at 
[21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1269) this first example that I drew I've given you two geometric vectors and asked you to find their dot product based on the formulas that we found earlier the dotproduct of geometric 
[21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1280) vectors is this formula I just multiply their magnitudes and then multiply that by the coine of the angle between the two vectors so for this question I would say that a do B is equal to the 
[21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1292) magnitude of a which is 20 * the magnitude of B which is 30 time cosine of the angle between the two vectors which is 40° and if I do that calculation it's approximately 
[21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1306) 49.6 now remember what did this calculation actually find the product of we actually found the product of the magnitude of one of the vectors let's say the magnitude of vector B with the 
[21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1318) magnitude of the projection of vector a onto Vector B which would look like this Vector right about here which is parallel to B and would form a 90° angle right here when connected back to the 
[22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1330) tip of vector a and now let's do an example for algebraic vectors since I'm giving two algebraic vectors in this example I can use this formula to find their dot product where I find the 
[22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1342) product of the X components the product of the Y components and then add the results so for a b I multiply the X component of a by the X component of b 5 * 4 plus multiply the Y 
[22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1356) component of a by the Y component of b -3 * 7 this gives me 20 + -21 which is1 so the dot product is1 and because that dot product is negative I know that the angle between the two 
[22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1373) vectors must be bigger than 90° must know number six cross product this is the second type of product you can do between two vectors this cross product is sometimes referred to as the vector 
[23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1391) product and that's because when you cross product two vectors your result is a vector so if you do Vector a cross Vector B you get a new Vector we'll call it Vector C where Vector C is 
[23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1404) perpendicular to both Vector a and Vector B and also the magnitude of vector C would be equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by Vector a and Vector B so let me draw two geometric 
[23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1418) vectors Vector a and Vector B so I can help you visualize what this means the most important part of cross product is that it generates a vector that is perpendicular to both of the original 
[23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1430) vectors and the only way that could happen is if we work in three dimensions anything that lays on the same plane as those two vectors can't be perpendicular to both of them so in order to draw the 
[24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1441) cross product Vector I would have to draw a vector that is perpendicular to the screen that you're looking at I'll do my best to depict that on this flat surface here if I say this is Vector A 
[24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1452) cross B that would mean that if I zoom in here it forms a 90° angle with Vector B and it also forms a 90° angle with Vector a and in order for that to happen this Vector would have to be coming 
[24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1465) straight out of the screen at you and we communicate that by saying Vector A cross B is coming out of the page now I know it's coming out of the page and not going into the page because of the right 
[24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1475) hand rule the right hand rule says lay your right hand along the first Vector that's in your cross product and curl your fingers towards the second Vector that's in your cross product and then 
[24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1486) your thumb will point in the direction of the cross product therefore A cross B would be going out of the page but if you were to try to do B cross a you'd have to lay your right hand along B and 
[24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1497) then try and colur your fing fingers towards a in order for that to happen you'd have to flip your hand upside down and your thumb would be pointing into the page so B cross a would be in the 
[25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1507) exact opposite direction of A cross B but it would have the exact same magnitude so the order of cross product is important because you can see you get vectors that are opposites of each other 
[25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1518) depending on whether you do a cross B or B cross a and then another part of the definition of cross product is that the magnitude of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed 
[25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1530) by A and B so let me roughly sketch that parallelogram and then the area of this parallelogram is equal to the magnitude of A cross B so how would I find the area of this parallelogram well the area 
[25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1542) of a parallelogram is just its base times its height so what would the height of this parallelogram be let me just turn this into a little right triangle here and labeled this as the 
[25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1553) height if I knew the angle between the two vectors based on soaa I know that sign of the angle would equal the opposite side over the hypotenuse and then if I rearrange this formula to 
[26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1564) isolate H I can see that the height of the parallelogram is equal to the magnitude of B sin Theta which means the magnitude of the cross product of A and B would be equal to the base which is 
[26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1578) the magnitude of a times the height which is equal to the magnitude of B * sin Theta so that gives you the magnitude of the cross product but if we wanted the whole cross product 
[26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1588) meaning the vector product we would need a direction as well so I could say that A cross B is equal to I want to keep the magnitude the same but I want to send it in a direction that is perpendicular to 
[26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1599) both of the original vectors to do that I could multiply the magnitude by a unit normal Vector n stands for normal which means perpendicular to both A and B now we use a positive unit normal Vector if 
[26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1613) the vector is coming out of the page if it was going into the page we would use a negative n hat and I should mention this formula is for if we have geometric vectors if we have algebraic vectors we 
[27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1624) need a different formula that looks complicated but I'll do an example to show you that it's actually pretty easy I'll jot that formula down now for you and now let's go ahead and do an example 
[27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1634) where we use each of those formulas in this first example I've made it asks to find U cross V and then it gives us two geometric vectors so we'll be using this formula right here which tells us to 
[27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1645) multiply the magnitudes of the vectors time sign of the angle between them times a normal unit Vector to send it in a direction perpendicular to both of the original vectors so if I follow that 
[27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1655) formula for this example U cross V would equal the magnitude of U * the magnitude of V Time s of the angle between the two vectors which is 40° that would give me the magnitude of the cross product but I 
[27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1671) want the whole Vector cross product so I need to send this in a direction perpendicular to both of those vectors if I follow the right hand rule laying my right hand along U and curling my 
[28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1682) fingers towards V my thumb will be pointing out of the screen or out of the page so I need to multiply this by a positive n hat and then an approximate value for this would be 
[28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1695) 35.7 n hat or instead of writing n hat you can say out of the page let's try another example in example two we're finding the cross product of two vectors but those two vectors are given in their 
[28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1709) component form as algebraic vectors in order to find their cross product I'm going to have to follow this formula for finding the cross product of algebraic vectors in order to find the 
[28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1721) difference of all of these products to get my three components of my cross product Vector there's a format I can rewrite these vectors in to make those calculations quite simple each of these 
[28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1732) vectors has three components they have an x a y and a z component because remember cross product we need a z component because cross product can only be done in three dimensions in order to 
[29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1744) do the cross product I'm going to write the components of each of those vectors underneath their corresponding vectors in a very specific order the order is second component third component first 
[29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1756) and then second if I sub these components into their proper spots down here I can now find my cross product Vector to get the X component of my cross product Vector I need to do 3 * 6 
[29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1770) which is 18 and then subtract the product of 2 and -5 which is -10 that gets me the X component of my cross product Vector to get the Y component I do 2 * 2 which is 4 and then subtract -1 
[29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1786) * 6 which is -6 and then lastly to get the Z component I find the product of-1 and -5 which is 5 and then subtract the product of 3 and 2 which is 6 and then if I simplify each of those components I 
[30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1801) get the vector 28 101 and this Vector is perpendicular to both Vector a and Vector B so let me zoom out so you can see everything we 
[30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1815) did for cross product and let's move on to the next part must know number seven how to write the vector equation of a line let's say we have a line I'll label it with L for 
[30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1831) now a vector equation of a line is an equation that describes the resultant vectors that start at the origin and end at a point on the line that equation often looks like this we say Vector R 
[30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1845) the resultant Vector equals the sum of two things Vector R KN which is a position Vector plus T which is a scalar multiplied by Vector M which is a direction vector which is a vector 
[30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1858) parallel to the line so let me Define those for you and also give you a representation to help you understand why this format of an equation could Define a line so Vector R KN is a 
[31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1872) position Vector to any point on the line so I'll sketch a sample position Vector it just has to start at the origin and finish at some point that's on our line the next part of the vector equation is 
[31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1884) Vector M Vector m is a direction vector that is parallel to the line so I'll also sketch a vector that's parallel to the line now the key thing with this equation is that I need to add any 
[31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1898) scalar multiple of that direction Vector to my position vector and the resultant will be at some point on my line and remember multiplying a vector by a scalar can make it shorter or longer or 
[31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1911) send it in the opposite direction if it's negative but it will still be parallel to my original Vector m so I'll add a scalar multiple of this Vector to R KN by drawing it tip to tail with r KN 
[32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1924) up here now because these vectors are tip to tail the resultant of adding R KN plus the scalar multiple of my direction Vector is going to go from the tail of the first Vector to the tip of the 
[32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1936) second vector and notice this resultant Vector goes to a point that's on my line and no matter what scalar multiple of my direction Vector I used the resultant Vector would still go to a point on the 
[32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1949) line let's now try an example where we calculate the vector equation of a line This example says write the vector equation of a line that passes through each of these two points to write the 
[32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1960) vector equation of a line the two most important things I need are the position vector and the direction Vector the position Vector R not is a vector that points to any point on the line so I 
[32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1972) have two points that are on the line I'll choose a vector that points to point a that would be the the vector 4 -31 to find the direction Vector I need a vector that's parallel to the line so 
[33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1985) I'll use the vector that connects these two points together that would be the vector AB or ba I'll use Vector a and when finding a vector that connects two points together you do the coordinates 
[33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=1998) of the point at the tip of the vector minus the coordinates of the points at the tail of the vector always tip minus tail so to get the X component of vector a I do the x coordinate of B minus the x 
[33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2011) coordinate of a 2 - 4 is -2 the Y component of my Vector y coordinate of the tip minus y coordinate of the tail -3 - -3 is 0o and then the Z component of my Vector Z coordinate of the tip 
[33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2024) minus Z coordinate of the tail 7 - 1 is 6 and with any direction Vector we want the simplest Direction Vector as possible so we need to reduce this vector by removing a common scalar from 
[33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2036) all three terms I noticed that I could divide out a -2 from all three terms and that would leave me with the vector 1 0 -3 so I'll use this Vector 1 -3 as my direction Vector so the vector equation 
[34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2052) of my line we could write Vector R the resultant equals or the way it's more commonly written is Vector XY Z which stands for our resultant Vector equals the position Vector 431 
[34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2068) plus a scalar multiple of the direction vector and we'll use the reduced version 1 0 -3 and then no matter what scalar I subbed in for T if I were to do this Vector plus any scalar multiple of that 
[34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2082) Vector the resultant Vector would be at a point on my line and as a bonus for this section you should also know what the parametric equations of a line are as well to write the parametric 
[34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2093) equations of a line you just separate the resultant Vector into its X Y and Z components to calculate the X component of the resultant Vector we would do 4+ T * 1 the Y component is -3 + 0 t so 
[35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2110) the Y component is always -3 and the Z component is 1 + -3 * T so those are the parametric equations of the line must know number eight how to find the equation of a plane now a plane is 
[35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2131) just a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions and we can write the equation of a plane in two different formats we can write the vector equation of a plane or the scalar 
[35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2141) equation of a plane let's start with the vector equation of a plane I'll start by trying to draw a diagram that shows you a plane so I've got my three-dimensional cartisian grid and on here I'm going to 
[35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2152) try and draw depiction of a plane to write the vector equation of a plane it's going to look similar to the vector equation of a line it's going to be a resultant Vector that points to any 
[36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2164) point on this plane I'll call it Vector XYZ and we get it by starting with a position Vector R KN and to that we need to add scalar multiples of two different direction vectors so plus T * Direction 
[36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2179) Vector 1 plus s time Direction Vector number two Let Me Define for you what those vectors are and then show you in this diagram so you understand why the formula makes sense R KN is a position 
[36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2193) Vector that starts at the origin and goes to any point that's on this plane so I'll start by defining it and I'll draw a position Vector to any point on this plane and then M1 and M2 are both 
[36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2206) vectors that are parallel to this plane but are not parallel to each other so I'll show you what that looks like I'll draw One Direction Vector which notice it lays on the plane so it's parallel to 
[36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2218) the plane and then I'll draw another Vector that lies on the plane but is not parallel to the original Direction vector and notice if I were to add these three vectors together since they're all 
[37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2229) tipped to tail with each other the resultant would go from the tail of the first Vector to the tip of the third Vector which is a point that's on the plane and by varying the scalars that we 
[37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2240) multiply by these two direction vectors we can get to any point on this plane anywhere we want next let's talk about the scalar equation of a plane the scalar equation 
[37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2251) of a plane I think is a little bit easier it takes the format ax + b y + CZ + D equal Z now to explain what all those parameters in that equation represent let me first sketch a plane 
[37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2266) and I'm also going to draw a vector that is perpendicular to this plane we call that a normal Vector if it's perpendicular to the entire surface of the plane it's called a normal vector 
[37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2277) and why that normal Vector is important is because the components of that normal Vector correspond to the A B and C values of the standard form equation so I'll make a note of that here where the 
[38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2289) normal vector vector ABC is perpendicular to the plane and now let me make a bit of room and we'll do an example this question says determine the equation of the plane that passes 
[38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2299) through these three points we'll start by finding the vector equation of the plane and then we'll also do the scalar equation to find the vector equation I need a position vector and that's a 
[38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2309) vector that goes to any point on the plane I'll make it go to point B but any three of the points could be chosen so I'll use my position Vector as the vector 4 6 2 and then I need two 
[38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2320) direction vectors that are parallel to the plane but are not parallel to each other my first Direction Vector I'll make it the vector that connects point A to point B to find Vector a I do the 
[38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2332) coordinates of the point at the tip of the vector minus the coordinates of the point at the tail 4 - -3 is 7 6 --1 is also 7 and 2 - -2 is 4 and then I need a second Direction Vector it can't be 
[39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2347) parallel to this one so I can't use Vector ba so I'll connect two different points how about point A to point C once again the coordinates of the point at the tip of the vector minus the 
[39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2358) coordinates of the point at the tail so I can now write the vector equation it equals my position Vector plus T * my first Direction vector plus s * my second Direction vector and no matter 
[39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2370) what you chose for T and S the result would be a point that's on the plane let's also find the scalar equation to find the scalar equation I need a normal Vector a vector perpendicular to the 
[39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2382) plane well I know these two vectors are both parallel to the plane so if I did the cross product of the two of them it would generate a vector perpendicular to both of them which would be a vector 
[39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2393) that's perpendicular to the whole plane so my normal vector is going to be the cross product of my two direction vectors and when doing the cross product underneath each of these 
[40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2404) vectors I follow the order of writing the second component third component then first then second so underneath M1 7 4 7 7 and underneath M2 same thing second component third first second to 
[40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2422) get the X component of my cross product I do 7 * 3 - 4 * -3 21 - -12 that's 33 and then the Y component 4 * 8 which is 32 - 7 * 3 which is 21 that gives me 11 and the Z component 
[40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2442) 7 * -3 - 7 * 8 that's -21 - 56 that's 77 and this normal Vector we want it to be as simple as possible so we can reduce it I could common factor out a from all three terms which will give me 
[40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2459) 3 1 -7 this Vector is still going to be perpendicular to the plane it's just shorter than that Vector so I'll use this one as my a b and c values in the scalar equation of the plane and 
[41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2475) remember the scalar equation looks like ax + b y plus CZ plus d equal 0 so I can replace a b and c with 3 1 and --7 and all we have left to do 
[41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2491) is solve for the D value and I can do that by subbing any point I know that is on the plane in for X Y and Z if I scroll up a little bit I know that any of those three 
[41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2503) points are on the plane I'll use this one the 462 so back into this scalar equation for x y and z I'll sub in 4 6 and 2 and then to solve for D I have 12 + 6 which 
[41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2516) is 18 minus 14 which is four move it to the other side and I figure out that the D value is-4 which means my scalar equation I sub in for a b c and d which will give me 3x + 1 y - 7 Z - 4 = 0 and 
[42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2535) there's the scalar equation of that plane must know number nine finding the intersections of lines in three SP SP now in two Dimensions if two lines are not parallel they have to intersect at a 
[42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2552) point but in three dimensions if two lines are not parallel they might intersect at a point or they might not even intersect at all meaning the lines are skewed so let's do an example where 
[42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2565) I give you two nonparallel lines and we see if they intersect at a point or if they're skewed let's find the point of intersection of the following lines if it exists so upon inspection I notice 
[42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2577) that these two direction vectors are not scalar multiples of each other therefore these lines are not parallel what we do to figure out what scenario we have is we start by writing the parametric 
[43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2587) equations of these lines so I need to break each of the resultant vectors into their X Y and Z components so for line 1 the X component is equal to 5 + 1 s y = -4 + 2 s and Z = -2 + 3s and then I'll 
[43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2606) do the same same thing for line two and now I want to know is there a single point that satisfies both of these equations so can I find an S and A T value that gets to the exact same point 
[43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2620) what I'll start by doing is setting the X's equal to each other setting the Y's equal to each other and setting the Z's equal to each other and now let me simplify each of these equations that 
[43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2631) I've made I'll get the constant on the left and the variable terms on the right for each of them and now my goal is is to see is there a value of T and Fs that satisfies all three of these equations 
[44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2642) meaning that their X Y and Z components will all be equal to each other to do that I'll start just by picking two of the equations I'll pick equation 2 and three 
[44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2655) and with those two equations I'll solve for what values of T and S satisfy those two equations I'll use the method of elimination so I'll stack the equations 
[44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2665) on top of each other and then I noce if I were to subtract the like terms in these equations the T variable would eliminate I would have -1 = s and then I'll take that value I got for S and sub 
[44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2678) it back into either equation 2 or three for S and then solve for T I'll sub it into equation 2 for S if I solve this equation for T I'd have t = 2 + 4 so t equal 
[44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2693) 6 so this value of T and this value of s satisfy these two equations meaning if I were to sub those values into the vector equations of the lines it would make their y's and their Z's be equal to each 
[45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2709) other but I don't know if it makes the X's equal as well to check that we have to put both of these values into the equation we made from the X components equation number one and see if it 
[45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2720) satisfies equation number one as well so I'll do that check up here so I've separated equation one into left side and right side I'll sub in my value of T which is 6 and my value of s which is -1 
[45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2732) and I see that the right side of the equation becomes 13 which is not equal to the left side of the equation so that means that if I were to use these values of T and S it makes the Y and Z of each 
[45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2745) of the lines be the same but not the X's which means the lines must not intersect so we would say these lines are skewed if when doing the check we did get left side equal to right side that would mean 
[45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2757) that the lines do intersect and then you could take your value of t or your value of s and sub it into either of your original lines and calculate your point of 
[46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2771) intersection must know number 10 how to find the intersection of two planes if two planes are parallel they can be parallel and coincident so there's an infinite number of points of 
[46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2782) intersection they could be parallel and distinct meaning they never intersect but what we're interested in for this section is if we have two nonparallel planes that they intersect in a 
[46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2794) line and I'll try and draw that for you so I'll start by drawing two planes that are not parallel to each other and if we're trying to find where these two planes intersect notice there's going to 
[46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2805) be an entire line of points that are shared by both of these planes and now let's do an example where I can teach you how to find the equation of that line that is shared by both of the 
[46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2816) planes this example says to find the intersection of this system which involves two planes the first thing I would do would be to compare the normal vectors of these two planes and remember 
[47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2826) the normal vectors are just the coefficients of the variables those two normal vectors are not scalar multiples of each other which tells me that the two planes are not parallel to each 
[47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2835) other so I know that the two planes will intersect in a line and to find that line of intersection I start by trying with these two equations to eliminate a variable so if I stack them on top of 
[47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2847) each other which they already are I could then subtract the equations from each other and these X variables would eliminate so if I subtract all the like terms I get - y + 4 Z = 2 and the next 
[47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2862) step is we assign a free variable of the two variables that are left I'm going to let one of them equal T so I'm going to say let Z equal T so basically I'm making the parametric equation for the Z 
[47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2877) component of my line I'm making it Z = 0 + 1 T which means the X component of my position Vector is zero and the X component of my direction Vector is one now I could have 
[48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2893) chosen any values for those two numbers but to make this as simple as possible we just choose 0 and one because then that simplifies to just Z equals T so I'll erase that and if Z equals t I can 
[48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2907) then go back and solve for what the X and the Y components would be equal to in terms of t as well so if Z is T into this equation I can let ZB T and then solve for y in terms of T and then if I 
[48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2920) rearrange this equation to isolate for y I would have y = -2 + 4T so now I have Z in terms of T and Y in terms of t i now need X in terms of t as well so I can take both of these sub them in for Z and 
[48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2937) Y in either plane one or plane two I'll sub them into plane one and now just isolate X so it's written in terms of T and I would have x = 5 - 5 T so these are the parametric equations of the line 
[49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2951) of intersection let me scroll down a bit and write them in the proper format so I can say the line of intersection is if I write the parametric equations got x = 5 - 5T y = -2 + 4T T and zal T or I could 
[49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2969) write the vector equation by taking the constant values as my position Vector so 5 -2 and 0 plus T time my direction Vector which is the coefficients of the t's so5 4 and one so no matter what 
[49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9ioZA9brtc&t=2984) value you subbed in for T you would get a point that is on the line of intersection which means you would get a point that satisfies the equation of both of those planes thanks for watching

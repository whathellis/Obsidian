# Transcript
[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=0) in this tutorial I will show you how to create your own custom material node groups in blender so in this video I'm going to share with you all the tips and tricks that I know to create your own 
[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=10) customizable node groups and here up on the screen are all of the different topics that I'm going to be going over in this video so if you're just looking for something specific then you can 
[00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=19) check out the video time stamps in the video description or if you'd like a complete overview on how to create your own customizable material node groups and you can watch the entire video so 
[00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=29) we're going to start off by going over the basics of how to create your own custom node groups that we're going to be going over some different shortcuts and then I'll show you the basics of 
[00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=37) setting up customizable values and then I'll go into more detail on how to control your custom material so I'll show you how to do things like how to scale the entire material also how to 
[00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=48) better organize your nodes and your node wires how to control other values like the base color and color ramps and Factor values when you're mixing between two materials how to change the 
[00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=59) roughness and bump and displacement of materials and also how to control specific values using a basic driver setup and many different tips and tricks on how to create your own custom 
[01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=70) material now real quick before we start videos like these are made possible thanks to my supporters and a great way to help support this channel is by checking out my ultimate blender 
[01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=80) procedural material pack so as you may know I do create a lot of procedural material tutorials and you can actually learn how to create any of my procedural materials by checking out my procedural 
[01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=89) material tutorial playlist here on YouTube and in my ultimate blender procedural material pack you will get all of my procedural materials pre-set up in blender's asset browser with 
[01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=99) custom thumbnails sorted catalogs and customizable node groups and you can also check out my procedural material packs if you'd like to purchase packs of 10 materials you can also get all of my 
[01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=109) materials individually on my gumroad store and my patreon page and purchasing the materials is a great way to help support me and this channel so I can continue to create these free tutorials 
[01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=119) now at the beginning beginning of this video I did want to mention that I will be using the node Wrangler add-on in this tutorial so if you don't have the node Wrangler enabled you can click here 
[02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=128) on edit and you can go to the preferences and then over there in the add-ons tab you can search for node Wrangler and then check mark the node Wrangler add-on and now that the node 
[02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=136) Wrangler is enabled you can hold down the control and shift key and then select different nodes and that is going to preview the node on the object so I'll be using the node Wrangler add-on 
[02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=146) here and there in the video so as I mentioned if you're looking for something specific then you can check out the video timestamps in the description but let's start off with the 
[02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=154) basics of how to create a custom node group so as an example I'm using my procedural damage metal material and I have a tutorial on this material so links in the description if you'd like 
[02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=164) to check that out and this material is also available on my gumroad and patreon and it's also included in my ultimate material pack but you can also follow along using any material that you have 
[02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=174) so to create a customizable node group you first need to just select all the nodes that you want to be in the node so I'm going to click and drag just to box select all of these nodes now I'm not 
[03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=184) going to select the material output just because I prefer the material output to be outside of the node group you could select it and join it together in the node group if you wanted to but I prefer 
[03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=193) not to select it because it's not really part of the material it's just the material output so I'm just going to box select all the nodes except for the material output and then to create a 
[03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=203) custom node group you can press Ctrl G so Ctrl G is going to join all the selected nodes into a node group and it's going to bring you inside the node group and you can also see that there 
[03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=214) are now two new nodes right over here and here on either side so over here we have a group output and so any values which are going into the group output you'll be able to see those values 
[03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=224) outside of the node group and then the same thing applies right over here so we also have a group input node and any values which are going into the group input you'll be able to see and control 
[03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=234) outside of the node group now for some reason you like deleted these nodes like if I select this and press X do delete it you can press shift a go to the search and you can search for a group 
[04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=244) input node and then just add it in again but make sure you are inside of the node group when you're adding in the group input or the group output now we join the node together into a node group and 
[04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=254) we are inside of the node group right now now to go in and out of the node group you can press the tab key so the Tab Key will bring you in and out of the node group if you have the node group 
[04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=264) selected and then you can also resize the node group so I'm just going to click and drag and I can drag this out to make it bigger and I can also just like drag it over here next to the 
[04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=273) material output now you can also rename the node group just by clicking right here and then you can just make a name and the name of the node group can actually be separate from the material 
[04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=282) name so you can see this material here this is the damage metal material but I can rename the node group to something different if I want to and that's a point that I want to make in this video 
[04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=291) and that is that the material is actually separate from the node group so basically there is a material and then within that material you can have different node groups and other node 
[05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=301) setups and if you wanted to have multiple node groups you could do that as well within the same material so this is my procedural Moss material again I'll have links in the description if 
[05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=310) you'd like to check out this Moss material and you can see in this material I actually have four different node groups so this is the Moss material but then I have the Moss material I have 
[05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=320) the Moss only material and then I have some different Moss factors and I actually have two different material outputs and because this material output is red it is using this material output 
[05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=330) however if I just select this material output now it's using this one instead and so this material output is going into the Moss only and so this is a slightly different Moss material where 
[05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=341) the entire object is moss so that's just something that I want to point out that you can have multiple node groups within the same material now you might have also noticed that there is a drop down 
[05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=351) here on this custom node group and this drop down will allow you to select different node groups within your blender file so these are all of the custom node groups which enter in this 
[06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=360) blender file and so I can actually choose between these so I can take this custom node group and I could change it so I could change it to the Moss and now we have the Moss material but I'll just 
[06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=369) change this back to the damaged metal and then I want to put the Shader here I want to put that into the surface so that we can actually see the material now this drop down over here this is 
[06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=379) actually a little bit different because this drop down is the material drop down so it's going to show you all the materials within this blender file whereas this drop down is going to show 
[06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=388) you all the custom node groups so again I just want to make you aware that there is a difference between the material and the node groups now one more thing that I wanted to mention about node groups is 
[06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=397) that once you have a node group in a blender file you can add it just like any other node so for instance I can press shift a let's go to the search and I can search for the Moss material I can 
[06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=408) then click on the Moss material and here it is right here so I can search for it just like if I were to add any node which is in blender and if you don't want to go to the search and type it in 
[06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=418) you can also just press shift a and then you can go down here to group and it's going to show you any node groups that you've created or that you have in the blender files data so as I mentioned if 
[07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=428) you want to join nodes together into a node group you select the nodes and then you press Ctrl G however if you want to unjoin nodes from a node group you can select the node group and then you can 
[07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=438) press Ctrl alt G so Ctrl G will join the nodes together into a node group and then you can press the Tab Key to go in and out of the node group and then with the node group selected you can also 
[07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=450) press Ctrl alt G to bring the nodes out of the node group alright so now let's go over the basics of how to edit your node group so as I mentioned with the node group selected you can press the 
[07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=461) tab key and the Tab Key will go in and out of the node group now inside the node group if you press the N key that's going to open up the side panel here and then you can click right over here on 
[07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=472) the group Tab and the group tab is going to have settings for the inputs and the outputs and so these inputs and outputs are going going to be linked with the group input and the group output inside 
[08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=484) your node group so for instance if I didn't want this to be called bsdf right here on the group output I could double click on this and I could rename it to Shader and when I do that it's also 
[08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=494) going to rename this value here to Shader on the group output now you can also click on the plus here if you want to add a new output so I can click on this plus here that's going to add a new 
[08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=504) output and you can see it just copied the other one so now it just has the same name but I could double click on this and I could for instance rename it to displacement and then just like we 
[08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=514) added a group output or a group input by clicking on the plus here if you want to get rid of a group input or a group output you can select the output or the input and then you can click on the 
[08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=524) minus button and that will get rid of it now if I wanted to reorganize the inputs and the outputs you can just click on an input or an output and you can click on these arrows here and that'll bring it 
[08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=534) up and down and then also if you want to change the type you can change it right here so these green values these are Shader values because they are green but displacement values are not shaders they 
[09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=545) are vectors so if you click here on this type if you click on the displacement then click on the type you could change it to a vector instead and now you can see it's going to be a purple Dot and 
[09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=555) because we don't have anything plugged into it it's just added these three values here so then if I had some displacement that I wanted to add to the group output I could press shift a I 
[09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=563) could go to the search and I could search for the displacement node and just add it here and then I could take the displacement and I could plug that up to the displacement right here and 
[09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=572) then if I press the Tab Key to go out of the node group I now have this displacement value here and this is on the output of the node so it's on this side so I could take the displacement 
[09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=581) and I could put that into the displacement of the material output and whatever is going into the material output that is what you're actually going to be able to see on the object 
[09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=589) now if I hit the Tab Key to go into the node group a much easier way to add the group inputs and outputs would just be to add a new value into the socket here so right here on the group output as as 
[10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=600) well as the group input right over here there is an extra socket here and you can add values into it and then it's going to show up right here on the inputs and outputs here on the side 
[10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=609) panel and it's also going to show up if you go outside of the node group so if I go back into the node group I'm going to go over here I'm just going to click on the displacement and hit the minus to 
[10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=618) get rid of it so I can now take the displacement here and I can just put that into this gray value here and when I add this in it's going to add it right here and it's automatically going to add 
[10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=626) it as a vector type and then if I hit the Tab Key to go out of the node group we now have a displacement value outside of the node group and I can just take the value here and I can just put that 
[10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=635) into the displacement and then just like we're doing this for the group output you can do the same thing for the group input and you're probably going to be using the group input much more because 
[10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=643) that's where you add all the different custom values so here's the group input and right up here we also have a inputs Tab and that's going to act exactly the same as the outputs tab so you can add 
[10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=654) any values that you want to control into the group input and then you'll be able to control that outside of the node so for an example I have this Musgrave texture right here and we have the scale 
[11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=664) and so this will just change the scale of the muskrave so I can take the scale value here I can take this gray Dot and I'm going to put this into the group input so put it into the extra socket 
[11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=674) and you can see it's going to add it right up here and as I mentioned you can click on the plus here to add new inputs you can also click on the minus to get rid of inputs and then if you have 
[11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=682) multiple inputs you can click on these arrows here and that is going to reorganize them so now that we have this scale value I can double click on this if I want to rename it so you can't 
[11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=693) actually rename it here but if you double click right here you can rename this and so I want to rename this to Musgrave scale because it's controlling the scale of this Musgrave texture so 
[11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=704) now if I hit the Tab Key to go out of the node group we have the Musgrave scale outside of the node group and we can change it and it's going to affect the same Musgrave scale outside of the 
[11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=714) node group and we also have this gray value right here and so if we want to add any node into this value we could do that and then it would control the Musgrave scale for an example I could 
[12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=723) press shift a I could go to the search and I could search for a value node and I could just drop the value right here and so this value is simply a number value and so I could plug the value up 
[12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=734) to the Musgrave scale and then I could just change this value and now since this value is going into the Musgrave scale that is going to control the Musgrave texture scale of the original 
[12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=744) Musgrave texture but in this case that doesn't really make any sense because I could just delete this value and I could instead just use this scale right here and so if I hit the Tab Key to go back 
[12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=753) into the node group I can continue to add more and more values into this group input so let's say I also want to control the detail of the Musgrave I could plug this in here and then if I 
[12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=762) click right here to rename this I could rename it to Musgrave detail and then let's add some more values so I could also add the dimension plug that in there I could also add this noise 
[12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=771) texture scale so I could drag this and plug that in there and I could click on this to rename it and I'm going to rename it to noise scale and then let's say I wanted the noise scale to be above 
[13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=782) the Musgrave scale if I click on the noise scale I can click on the arrows here and I can bring it up so now that it's on the top if I go outside of the node Group by hitting the Tab Key you 
[13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=792) can see the noise scale is now on the top and so I can drag this around to control the noise scale and you can just continue to add really any custom value into the group input now something else 
[13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=802) to note is that you can choose a default value for these different custom values so if I hit the Tab Key to go into the node group right over here on the inputs if you want to see all of them you can 
[13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=813) click here on these little dots and drag this out and if you click on these there's going to be some different settings here but right here on any of the values you can see there is a 
[13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=821) default value that you can choose so if I just go outside of the node group I can drag the noise scale around and let's just say that I like 4 as the default scale so now if I hit the Tab 
[13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=831) Key to go into the node group if I click on the noise scale right here on the default it's just set it up automatically to the value that we originally added so when we plug this in 
[14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=840) in it was at 3.3 but I could click on the default here and I could change it to 4. now why setting the default value is important is because if I press the Tab Key to go out of the node group 
[14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=851) let's just say that I've added a new material and I want to add in a custom node group that I've created well I can press shift a I can go to the search and I can search for the damaged metal I can 
[14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=862) drop this here and you can see now the noise scale is set to 4 on default so that's why you may want to set a default value so it's already out of value that you like and then as well as controlling 
[14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=872) the default value you can also control the maximum and minimum values so for instance let's take this Musgrave detail so if I drag the Musgrave detail down if I turn it way down to like a very small 
[14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=885) number you can see it just looks a little lumpy and that doesn't look very realistic so let's say I wanted the Musgrave detail to have a minimum value of seven so seven you can see seven is 
[14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=896) pretty detailed but you may also want it to be all the way to the maximum value which is 15. so if I hit the Tab Key to go into the node group you can go right up here to the inputs and I can click on 
[15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=906) the Musgrave detail and right down here you have minimum and maximum values so I didn't like the minimum value being anything smaller than 7 because it just didn't look very realistic so here on 
[15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=915) the minimum value I can click on this and I can change it to 7 and then you could choose a maximum value I'm going to leave it at 15. so now if I press the Tab Key to go out of the node group I 
[15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=925) can drag the Musgrave detail up to the max of 15 but if I try to drag it down to zero you can see the minimum value is 7. now if I type in a specific value that will override the value so if I 
[15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=936) click on this and just type in like one and you can see it looks all lumpy now and it's not very detailed so you can override that just by typing in a manual number but if I turn this up and then 
[15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=946) try to turn it down you can see 7 is the minimum value and then one other custom setting that I want to show you if I tab to go back into the node group if I click on the Musgrave detail you can see 
[15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=956) here there is a hide value so if I check mark the hide values now if I tab to go out of the node group you can see the Musgrave detail is still in the custom node group but I don't actually have a 
[16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=967) value that I can drag around however I do have a number value slot here and so I could plug any value up to the Musgrave detail so for instance I could press shift a I could go to the search 
[16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=977) and I could search for like a value and I could drop the value right here and then I could plug the value up to the Musgrave detail so this way now this value is going to control the Musgrave 
[16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=987) detail now I find this setting not very useful I haven't really used it for any of my custom materials but I thought I'd mention it in this video if any of you find it useful now as well as 
[16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=997) controlling the different custom values for the different textures and the other nodes you can do the same things for the different shaders for instance the principle Shader this is probably the 
[16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1007) Shader which you most commonly use you can again just plug all the different values into the group input now later in this video I'll be going into more detail on different complex setups like 
[16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1017) for instance how to control color ramps and how to control the different colors of your material and also how to control values if you have a texture going into the Shader so I'll be going over those 
[17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1028) more complex things later in this video and of course you can check the time stamps in the description to jump to a certain part but you can control any of these other values on the Shader just 
[17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1037) like we did with the textures so for instance maybe the metallic value if I want to control whether it's more metallic or less metallic I could drag this over here and I could stick it here 
[17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1046) into the group input another thing I could do is I could just drag the group input over here for now just so that it's a bit closer I could also put the roughness value in here and also the 
[17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1056) base color so if I just want to change the base color here I could take the yellow dot here on the base color and I could put that into the group input and then of course I can reorganize these so 
[17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1065) maybe I want the base color to be on top I could click on the arrows and bring it up here I could also double click on this to rename it and I could just rename it to color and then when you go 
[17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1074) outside of the node group you can see all the different values so there is the roughness there is the metallic and and there is also the color here now another cool custom value that I want to show 
[18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1084) you is how to change the random seed of a texture so the procedural Textures in blender often have the dimension value right here and on default they are set to 3D however I could change this to 4D 
[18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1097) and if I change it to 4D the texture will change a little bit I have the node Wrangler enabled so if I just control shift and select the Musgrave texture you can see the difference between 3D 
[18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1106) and 40 so it does change a little bit it does change to kind of the location it does look a bit different but if I now change it to 4D we have this W value and you can use this W value basically as a 
[18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1117) random seed and you can do this for pretty much any of the other textures so if I control shift and select the noise texture to preview it I could click on the 3D here I could change it to 4D and 
[18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1128) now I have this cool W value here and I can drag this around to change the random seed of the noise so then what I could do is take the W value I could stick this right in here and then I 
[18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1138) could click on this to rename it and I could print instance rename it to noise C now if I go outside of the node group and I control shift and select the Shader to preview the final material I 
[19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1147) could drag the noise seat around and you can see that it's going to change the noise for the damaged part of the metal now this brings me to the next topic that I want to talk about and that is 
[19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1156) how you can take one value and you can use it to control multiple values so if I hit the Tab Key to go into the node group let's say I want to control the W values for both this Musgrave and this 
[19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1169) noise at the same time you could really do this for any amount of textures what you can do is you can actually drag multiple values into the same socket so instead of putting this into a new 
[19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1180) socket I could if I wanted to I could put it into the new socket here and then I would have another W value here for the Musgrave but let's say I wanted one value which is going to control the 
[19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1189) random seed for both textures well I can just take the W and I can put that into the noise seed here and then if I double click on this to rename it instead of it being called noise feed I could maybe 
[20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1200) rename it to texture C so now if I go outside the node group I can drag the texture seed and as well as it changing the noise which is the dark gray right there it's also going to change the rust 
[20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1212) which is kind of that orange color now the only problem with this is if you have different number values that you want to be applied on both of the textures so for an example I'm just 
[20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1221) going to get rid of all these input sockets here just so that it's a bit more simple and we can kind of restart so let's say that I want to have one custom value which is going to control 
[20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1229) the detail of multiple textures but this Musgrave texture I want to be at the max of 15 but then let's say for some reason on the noise texture I only want to have a maximum detail of six you can see 
[20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1241) here's the noise texture and it's not very detailed and then here's the Musgrave and it's very detailed well if I put the detail into the group input and then also take this detail here and 
[20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1250) put it into the group input it's going to use the same number value because it is going into the same socket so if I go out of the node group now this detail is changing both the details at once so I'm 
[21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1261) not able to have two different detail levels if I want to control the detail level with one value however there is a way to fix this so if I go inside the node group what I can do is press shift 
[21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1271) a I can go to the search and I can search for a math node so I can click on the math node and I'm going to drop it here between the group input and the noise texture detail and then in this 
[21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1283) case what I need to do is take the detail here and I need to put it into the bottom value and then because I want to make this a smaller detail amount I want to click on the ad and I want to 
[21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1293) change it to divide instead so I can now drag this divide value around on the math node and this divide is basically going to offset this noise texture detail so I could make the detail amount 
[21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1305) very small by turning the Divide up you can see now it's not very detailed it's all lumpy but then over here this is the Musgrave texture and that's very detailed however if I go outside of the 
[21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1315) node group I can now drag the detail around and it's going to control the detail of both textures at once but I'm using the math node to offset the number value of the noise detail and I could do 
[22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1326) the same thing but the opposite way around so let's say that I wanted the noise texture detail to be much higher I could click on the divide and I could instead change it to multiply and then I 
[22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1336) could just turn this value way up so now if I go outside of the node group I could turn this detail amount way down and now because the detail amount is turned way down the Musgrave texture is 
[22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1347) not very detailed at all it looks all lumpy but you can see the noise right over here is still very very detailed and again that's because I'm offsetting this value by multiplying the number 
[22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1357) before it goes into the noise texture detail so this can be very helpful if you want more control over the different customizable values all right now the next topic of this video is how to 
[22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1367) better organize the node groups so sometimes when you're making a really large procedural material the nodes can become quite messy and can be hard to use so I'm now going to go over a few 
[22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1377) different tips and tricks on how to organize eyes your nodes better now one thing that I did want to mention is that you can actually change the curve of your node wires and you can see that my 
[23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1387) node wires are very straight and that's because I've set that up in blender's user preferences so to edit the curve of your node wires you need to go into blender's user preferences by clicking 
[23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1397) here on edit and then clicking on preferences click over on the themes button and then you're going to click on the Node editor just open this up and you can scroll way down and here on the 
[23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1407) bottom you can see that there is this noodle curving now on default in blender I believe it is turned to five but I prefer to turn it to zero just because I like that better but you could also turn 
[23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1418) it up higher if you want like 10 but I don't really like how that is and then you can also click on the save preferences button or it might be that the auto save preferences is already 
[23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1426) turned on so I'm just going to close the user preferences now another great way to organize your nodes is to add reroutes so you can press shift a and you can go to here to the search and you 
[23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1437) can search for a reroute and a reroute is just going to be one of these little dots here but an easier way to do this is to instead hold down the shift key and then right click and drag over a 
[24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1447) wire and let go and that is going to add a reroute here so it's just a little Dot and you can kind of drag it around so then what I could do is hold down the shift key and right click and drag and 
[24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1456) let go to add another one I could like drag this down here and if I wanted to like join all of the same wires into the reroute I could also hold down the shift key and I could right click and drag 
[24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1468) over all these wires and then let go and you can see it's going to join them all together into the same reroute and if you're ever wondering what value the reroute is it's always going to be the 
[24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1478) value of the other input which is behind it so basically it's just extending the noise texture factor out here and then all the different wires are going into the color ramps and the other nodes so I 
[24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1490) could drag these reroutes around maybe bring this one up here and also right here you can see there's like a wire which is overlapping before this wire goes into the bump so again I could hold 
[25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1500) down the shift key right click and drag and then let go and then I could drag this over here and I could like stick it down there also right up here we have a color ramp and then we have this wire 
[25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1509) here going into this mix so I could like drag this up here and drag this down and that way the wire isn't overlapping or what I could also do is hold down the shift key and right click and drag over 
[25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1519) the wire and I could like drag this down here so that maybe it is more straight I could also drag this up here and then we also have another wire which is overlapping this node so I could hold 
[25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1528) down the shift key right click and drag and maybe drag this down here now another great way to organize your nodes is to rename the nodes so as I mentioned earlier you can rename the node groups 
[25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1540) but you can actually rename each one of these nodes so right here on this Musgrave texture even though this is a Musgrave texture I could rename it to whatever I want so to rename a node you 
[25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1551) can select the node and then you can press f2 and that is going to add a node label so because this is controlling the rust I could bring name it to rust texture and I could do that for many 
[26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1562) other things so right here like on this mix node this mix node is controlling the rust color so even though this is a mix node I could select it and I could press f2 to add a label and I could just 
[26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1572) call this like rust color or if I wanted to I could call it rust color but then add the Little Mix at the end so that I can remember that this is a mixed node and then just like all nodes you can 
[26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1582) drag out the sides if you want to make them bigger or smaller I could also rename these bump nodes so if I control shift and select this color ramp this color ramp is controlling where the rust 
[26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1593) is and so the color is going into this bump here so I could click on this bump I could press f2 to add a label and I could call this rust bum so now it's easy to remember what bump node this is 
[26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1604) controlling because it has a label here now another great way to organize your nodes is by adding frames so as an example all these mixed nodes are controlling the colors so I could click 
[26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1614) and drag to box select all these nodes here and then I could press Ctrl J Ctrl J is going to join them together into a frame and I need to kind of move some of these nodes away so I'm going to box 
[27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1624) select these nodes move them back a little bit and now we have this cool frame right here and also I want to click and drag and then I just want to drop this reroute here into the frame so 
[27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1635) I can now click on the frame and I could drag the frame around and you can see it's going to control all the nodes here now you can also rename the frames so if I click on the frame I could press f2 
[27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1644) and that is going to add a label to the frame and I could just call this base color so now it's easy to remember that these nodes are controlling the base color and then if for some reason I want 
[27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1654) to bring a node out of a frame if I click on the Node I can press alt p and ALT P will bring the node out of the frame or I can just drag it here in the frame and then click and then it will 
[27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1665) drop it inside the frame and another way to add frames is just to press shift a go to the search and you can just search for a frame and you can just add it here and then you can just drag any nodes 
[27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1675) that you want into it so for instance I could drag this down here and then I I could drag this texture up here and just drop it in and also this texture here I could just drop it in and then I can 
[28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1685) drag this around and it will drag around all of the textures and another cool thing about the frames is I can actually change the color of them so here on this base color frame if I click on this 
[28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1695) Frame if you press the N key to open up the side panel you can click here on node and make sure you have the frame selected and there's actually a color right here so I can click on the drop 
[28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1705) down and I can click here to turn on the color and then I could make this whatever color I want so for instance I could make it like a dark blue color that's pretty cool and I could go over 
[28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1714) here to this one here click on this I could turn on the color and this one maybe I could make like an orangey color and you can also change the color of different nodes so for instance right 
[28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1724) here on this printable Shader I could click on this and if I click right over here on node right here on the color I could turn this on and then I could make this whatever color I want so for 
[28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1733) instance I could make it a green color so visually this might just look kind of nice to kind of separate things and if I hit Tab Key to go out of the node group I can actually make a color for my node 
[29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1744) group so if I click on the damaged metal again on the side panel here if you go to node you can click on color and then I could make this whatever color I want so maybe an orange color would look 
[29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1754) pretty cool now another way to organize your nodes inside of node groups is you can actually collapse nodes and if you collapse nodes it's only going to show you the values that you are using here 
[29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1764) on this principled Shader there might be a bunch of values that I'm not using and so just to make it a bit more simple I don't want to see all these extra values so if you click on the principled Shader 
[29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1774) or any other node you can press Ctrl H and Ctrl H is going to collapse the node so now it is smaller but because there are values going into the base color and the normal we still have sockets for 
[29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1786) those so again with the node selected just press Ctrl H control h will collapse or uncollapse the node and I can do the same thing for these mixes here or also these color ramps or also 
[29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1797) any of these textures just by pressing Ctrl H and another way to collapse nodes is to click on the little arrow here so let's say I just want to make this really small I could just click on this 
[30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1807) Arrow here and that's going to make it very small but you can still see that there's all those dots there so what I could do is press Ctrl H then I can click on the Arrow here and that's going 
[30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1816) to make it really small so if you have a giant node setup with lots of nodes and you want to make it really small you could just make that very minimal and it looks very clean and neat now another 
[30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1825) way to organize your nodes is you can actually add node groups within other node groups so for an example here I'm using my Mossy dirt material and I have a tutorial on how to create this and you 
[30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1836) can also purchase this Mossy dirt material on my gumroad store and patreon page and this Mossy dirt material is also in my ultimate procedural material pack so if I hit the Tab Key to go into 
[30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1846) the node group you can see I've added a frame for the dirt and I've also added a frame for the Moss because this Mossy dirt material is actually made out of two different shaders so we have the 
[30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1857) Moss Shader and then the dirt Shader and then I'm using this mix Shader to mix them together and so these frames are pretty nice they're a nice way to organize the nodes but what I could do 
[31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1865) instead is create node groups for just the Moss and just the dirt so just to show you I'm going to select the frames and I'm going to press X to delete it click on this Frame and press X to 
[31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1875) delete it so I can now click and drag and I can box select all of the Moss nodes and then I could press Ctrl G to join together into a node group and you can see in this node group there are 
[31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1886) inputs and outputs just like with the other node groups and again you can tab to go in and out of the node so then I could make this much bigger just so it looks nicer I can also rename it and now 
[31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1896) we just have a node group for our Moss I can do the same thing for the dirt so I can click and drag just a box select all these nodes and I can press Ctrl G and then I can hit the tab view to go out of 
[31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1908) the node group and I can drag this out to make it bigger and right here I can rename this so I can rename it to dirt so I now have a node group for the Moss and the dirt but if I want to go out of 
[31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1918) the main node group group I just need to select one of the other nodes which isn't a node group and then I can press the tab key so now we have the mossy dirt and we still have all the different 
[32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1927) custom values but inside this node group we have another node group alright so I've just brought back my original damaged metal material and there's one more really great feature that I want to 
[32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1937) show you on organizing your node groups better so if I go into this damaged metal material you can see this looks quite messy and one reason why it looks very messy is because this group input 
[32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1948) has tons of little values and tons of little wires and if I drag this around you can see all the wires are going over each other and it just looks super messy but there's actually a really great 
[32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1957) feature to organize this better and that is that you can actually add multiple group inputs and multiple group outputs so you can press shift a you can go to the search and you could search for a 
[32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1969) group input and you can see it's going to basically link the same data because you can really only have one node group within a node group it's going to link the same data so the outside of a node 
[32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1979) group you have all the different custom values so you can add it that way or you can also just select the group input and you can press shift d to duplicate it so I can take this duplicated group input 
[33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1989) node and I can drag it right over here next to these mixed nodes and then what I want to do is press the N key to open up the side panel and just to make things more simple I will get rid of all 
[33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=1999) of these other custom values so we just have the scale so now that I have this group input here you can see the data is linked so this group input is going to have the same data as this one over here 
[33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2009) so what I can do is take this group input and then I can put all the colors into it so I can take the color here from this mix put that in there I can also take the mix from here put that in 
[33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2019) there and then also this white color here drag that in there and this one in here I can drag that in there so now the wires aren't going nearly as far they are still overlapping a little bit but I 
[33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2029) could kind of drag these around to make it look a bit nicer but instead of all of these wires going all the way across the material and kind of stretching and overlapping over all the nodes they're 
[33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2038) just right over here now one thing that you're going to need to be careful of is that you don't accidentally put two different values into the same socket because now this group input over here 
[34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2048) has these different sockets and so I wouldn't want to accidentally take a different node like for instance the Musgrave texture detail I wouldn't want to put that here in a because now a is 
[34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2057) controlling the color as well as the Musgrave texture detail so that's just something to be aware of but if I just rename these I can keep track of all the values so you can continue to do that by 
[34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2067) duplicating the group input so I can take this group input I can press shift d to duplicate it and I can drop it like down here and if I wanted to control any of these other values on the principled 
[34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2077) Shader I could drag this in here I could also drag this one in here so already this material is looking quite a bit more organized because we have this group input here which is controlling 
[34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2087) the colors we then have this one over here which is controlling some of the other values and then this one down here that's controlling the bump and then this one over here this can control the 
[34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2096) textures and the mapping now once you're finished with all all of this to make the group inputs look even nicer you can collapse the group inputs because you can see there's all these extra values 
[35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2106) here but we don't want to plug anything up to these values because they're being used on the other group inputs so what you can do at the very end once you've created your entire node group is you 
[35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2116) can hold down the shift key and you can select all of the group inputs then I can press Ctrl H and Ctrl H is going to collapse the group inputs so it's now only going to display the values which 
[35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2128) are plugged into those group inputs and you could also click on this little arrow here if you want to make it even smaller so again Ctrl H is the shortcut key to collapse and uncollapse the 
[35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2138) different nodes so now these are collapsed they look even nicer because it's only displaying the values that they are using alright so the next thing that I'm going to show you is how to 
[35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2148) scale the size of the entire material with one single value and as an example I've added in my procedural damage plaster material again links in the description if you'd like to check out 
[35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2158) that tutorial and you can also purchase the damaged plaster on my gumroad store and my patreon page but this isn't actually the final material because I've removed all of the scale values for 
[36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2168) demonstration in this video so I'm going to go inside the node group so to scale the entire material at once I need some way to be able to scale all the scale values of the texture and this damaged 
[36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2180) plaster has four different main procedural textures and so that's why I'm using it for a demonstration in this video in case you have a very complex material so if you just have one single 
[36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2190) material it might be as easy as just taking the scale for instance let's just take the noise scale and you could put the scale into this value now if I go outside of the node group you can use 
[36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2199) this scale to change the size of it but this isn't actually scaling the entire material it's just scaling the noise which is the damaged plaster now what I could do if I go back into the node 
[36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2209) group is I could just take all of the scale values from all the textures and I could put it into the same scale value so I could put the scale in here but the problem with this if I wave press Ctrl Z 
[37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2220) to undo that the problem with this is that these all have different scale values so this one here is 1.5 this one here is also five then we have these two at seven and then this one at 40. and if 
[37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2231) I plugged all the scale values into the same socket here then they would all use this same scale value so what we can do instead is we can add a mapping node and we can plug the mapping node up to the 
[37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2242) vector of the voronoi texture now on this original material I already had a texture coordinate mapping node but I deleted it just for demonstration in this video so if you have the node 
[37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2252) Wrangler enabled what you can do is select one of the textures and then you can press Ctrl T and that is going to add the texture coordinate and mapping nodes and I always use these when I'm 
[37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2262) creating procedural materials because I like to use the object coordinates and the object coordinates help to place the texture on the objects more evenly that just works best for most procedural 
[37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2273) materials so what I can do now is I can take the vector and I can put that into every vector value of all the textures in your entire material so now that I've done that we have the location the 
[38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2285) rotation and scale on the mapping and I can change these and that is going to affect the entire material because we've plugged it up to all the textures so now we can do is we can just take the scale 
[38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2295) here on the mapping and we can put that into the group input now if I press the Tab Key to go out of the node group you can see it's transferred over the X Y and Z values and in some cases you may 
[38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2307) want this so you may actually want to scale the material individually by each axis but I instead want this to be one single value so to change it to one single value we're going to go into the 
[38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2316) node group and then you can click here on the scale value on the side panel if you click over here on group so right now it is set to vector and that is because the mapping is Vector it is a 
[38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2326) purple dot but I can click on vector and I can change it to float instead this way it's going to use one single value because float is going to be number values now you can see it's gotten rid 
[38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2336) of the texture but that's just because I need to hit the Tab Key to go out of the node group and then here on the scale I need to turn it back to the default of one and now you can see the texture and 
[39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2346) now I can scale it just by dragging around this one single value now something else that's important to know is that when you go back into the node group when I turned the type to float 
[39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2355) you can see it turned the default value to zero you need to make sure you turn the default back to one or whatever default value you want and why it's important to have a default value is 
[39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2366) because if I go out of the node group let's say I want to add in this damaged plaster to this material I can press shift a I can go to the search or go down here to group and I can search for 
[39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2377) the damage plaster here's the damaged plaster so I can just add this in so I've added it in as a new node and they are the same node but you can see now the scale value has been turned to one 
[39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2387) whereas if I didn't have the default value set to 1 then this scale value would be turned to zero and if I turn it to zero now if I plug the Shader up to the surface you can see it's gotten rid 
[39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2397) of the texture so that just makes things a bit easier in the future when you're using the material to make sure that you have a default scale now normally when you add in data it's automatically going 
[40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2407) to add the default scale so for instance like this detail right here this is set to 15 so I just drag the detail into the extra socket here and then click here on detail you can see it's automatically 
[40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2417) set the default value to 15. so that's just something to note if you're ever changing the type here alright so for my next example I've added in my wood 3 material again I'll have a link in the 
[40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2428) description to this material and you can also purchase this material on my gumroad and patreon now another value that you might want to add to your node group are the other values of the 
[40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2436) mapping and so real quick I've added a mapping node here to show you the mapping so with a mapping we have a scale and I already talked about that how you can plug the scale in but this 
[40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2445) mapping node also has location and rotation values and so with some materials you may want to control the location and rotation as well as the scale and I've done that for my wood 3 
[40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2457) material now why I've added the rotation to the wood material is because wood grain has a consistent pattern and the wood is going in a certain angle so depending on what object you're adding 
[41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2468) this to you might want to change the rotation of the grain so if I want the grain of wood to be going back and forth I can change the Y rotation to 90 and now on this object here the grain of 
[41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2478) wood is going back and forth so if you want to change the rotation of the entire material at once then you can go into the node group and I've already done it here you can see what I've done 
[41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2487) is I've just taken the mapping rotation and I've just put that into the extra socket and then it added it as a rotation and you can do the same thing for the location so if for some reason 
[41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2497) you want to move the location of the entire material around you can go here into the node group and you can take the location socket here and you can put that into the extra socket and then you 
[41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2507) could rename it or move it around if you want to and so if I go out of the node group you can now see that we have location values so we have an X location and a z and a y location now let's say 
[41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2518) on the the location rotation or scale you wanted to control one or two of the values but not all three so we've already talked about how to control all the values at the same time and if you 
[42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2528) want to control all three values individually then you can plug the location rotation or scale up to the group input however what if you want to control just one or two of the values 
[42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2538) well to do that I've added in my procedural chocolate bar material again I'll have links in the description to this material and with this material I wanted to control the bar pieces X scale 
[42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2548) and the bar pieces y scale but not the Z scale because the X scale and the Y scale will go back and forth but I don't want to change the Z scale because the Z is going up and down so I've just 
[42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2559) deleted the X and Y scale on this chocolate bar material so that we can add it now and I'll show you how to control just one or two values but not three so if I go into the node group of 
[42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2568) this chocolate bar material here is this mapping and if I change these values I can change the size of those pieces of the chocolate bar however if I drag it to a certain amount like right here you 
[42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2579) can see it's going to mess up the texture of the chocolate bar so I don't want to be able to control the Z scale but I do want to be able to control the Y and X so I'm going to press shift a 
[43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2588) let's go to the search and I'm going to search for combine and let's add the combine x y z node so now what I can do is I can take the scale or the rotation and location just depending on whatever 
[43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2600) you're using and I'm going to put that into the vector this way it's going to take those three scale values from the mapping and it's going to break it up into a individual X Y and Z values now 
[43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2610) just to copy over the same X Y and Z scale I'm going to unplug this real quick and then I can hover my mouse over the x value press Ctrl C and then press Ctrl V to paste that I'm just going to 
[43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2621) do the same thing for the Y and the Z so I'm just copying the value and then pasting it in here so now the X Y and Z all have the same values so I can put the scale into the vector and so that's 
[43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2632) broken up the three values so let's put the X in here and then also the Y into the extra size pocket and then right here of course you could rename those values so now if I tab to go out of the 
[44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2643) node group we have the X here so I can change that scale and we have the Y here but it's not affecting the Z alright so I've added a new material and I'm now going to show you how to control custom 
[44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2654) color values so I've just added a new material I have this principle Shader here and real quick I'm going to make a very basic material but if you already have your own material you can just use 
[44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2663) your own material so what I'm going to do is press shift a and I'm going to search for a noise texture and then I will press Ctrl t with the noise texture selected and I'm going to plug the 
[44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2672) object up to the mapping so I can now take the noise texture factor and I want to put that into the base color now a very common thing that I do when I'm creating procedural materials is I use a 
[44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2682) color ramp to change the colors so I'll press shift a and I'm going to add a color ramp and let's put the color ramp between the noise texture and the base color so I can now change the two tabs 
[44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2692) here on the color ramp to actually change the colors of that noise so let's just maybe make this one green and then this one over here let's just make it blue and then I want to join this 
[45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2700) together into a node group so I'm going to box select all these nodes and I'll press Ctrl G so if you just have a very simple material that doesn't have a texture going into the base color of the 
[45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2710) Shader you can take the base color of the principal Shader or whatever Shader you're using and you could just plug that up to the group input however very often you are going to have some sort of 
[45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2720) texture which is affecting the base color so what if you want to control these colors well on the color ramp here it only has the factor but the factor has the noise texture going into it and 
[45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2730) we don't have any other sockets here that we can plug into the group input so I do really like using the color ramp but unfortunately it doesn't work very well when you're creating custom node 
[45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2740) groups so if you just have two colors on each side then a really easy way to create custom colors is to just add a mix node after the color ramp so I'm going to press shift a let's go to the 
[45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2751) search and I'm going to search for the mix node and let's drop this up here and then on default it's set to float and Float is number values but I want to click on this and change it to color 
[46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2760) instead then we can drop the mixed node here between the color ramp and the base color so instead of putting the color ramp into the color we can put it here into the factor of this mix and the 
[46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2771) factor is determining where it's going to be color a and where it's going to be color B so it's actually best if you put a black and white value into the factor so what I'm actually going to do is just 
[46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2781) click on these colors here and I'm going to transfer them over to the mix so I can take this blue color I can click and drag and drop the color into this and then I can click here on this color and 
[46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2791) I can click and drag and drop it here into value a so now if I select this color ramp I want to reset it so I'm just gonna with the color ramp selected hit the backspace and that's going to 
[46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2800) reset the color Ram so we now have this color ramp and this color ramp is going into the factor and the factor is determining where it's going to be color a and where it's going to be color B and 
[46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2810) to show you this better if I drag the white tab Over The Wider areas are telling it that it's going to be color B but then wherever the black areas are that's telling it that it's going to be 
[47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2820) color a so if you have a very simple setup with like a noise texture and a color ramp you can easily add this mix node and now that we have the mix node we have these values here so I can plug 
[47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2829) this here into the extra socket or I'll actually just plug it up here and then I can plug color B up to the extra socket and then of course if you press the end key to open the side panel you can 
[47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2840) rename the inputs in the outputs so if I now go out of the node group we have the different custom colors so I could make this like a green color and this one here I could make like a blue color so 
[47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2850) this is a very easy way to control the color values if you're just using a very simple color ramp with two colors but let's say that you have a color ramp which has multiple colors so what I'm 
[47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2860) going to do is click on the group input and right here I'm going to hit the minus just to get rid of those and then I will click on the mix and I will delete it and let's plug the color back 
[47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2869) up to the base color so to make this more complex I'm going to make four different colors so I will hold down the control key and then click right here and hold down the control key and click 
[47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2879) here to add more colors and then real quick I'm just going to make these a bunch of different colors so I'll make like a blue color let's also do like a red color and I'll do green so we now 
[48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2888) have a bunch of different colors and that is going into the base color so because we have a bunch of different colors we have more than two colors we can't simply add a mix node and drop it 
[48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2896) in here and then copy the colors over so to fix this what we need to do is use this color M data and we need to make different color ramps and we're going to use those color amps to make different 
[48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2906) black and white values and the different black and white values will be for each one of these colors and then we can take each one of those factors and we can mix them all together with mixed nodes so 
[48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2917) what I first want to do is just create a mask of where the blue colors are so to do this I'm going to click on this color ramp and I'm going to press Ctrl shift d so Ctrl shift d will duplicate the node 
[48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2927) but it'll keep the wire plugged up and I now want to delete these other two tabs but I just want to keep these two first tabs so I'm going to click on this tab and then I can hit the minus button and 
[48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2936) this tab here I can click on the minus button so we now just have these two tabs here so I now just want to make these two tabs white and black because we are creating a mask or a factor value 
[49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2946) so here on the red tab I'm going to click on this I'll go here to the RGB and I want to turn all of these up to one then here on the blue I can click on this one and this one I want to make 
[49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2956) fully black so if I control shift and select this color ramp this is where all the blue parts are so this blue color right here on the original color ramp that is showing up right here and a few 
[49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2967) other spots it's kind of subtle but it is there so I now want to do the same thing but for the other colors so I'm going to click on this color ramp I'll press Ctrl shift d and I'm going to drop 
[49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2976) it up here above the first one now on the first color ramp we use the first and second but on this color ramp I want to use the second and third so I'm going to click on this color here I'll click 
[49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2986) on the minus and then click on this color here click on the minus to get rid of it so now we just have the second and third values and it is important that these values are at the same exact 
[49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=2996) positions and so that's why I duplicated them from this color ramp so back here on this color ramp we want to take this one and we want to make it fully black and then this one here this green one I 
[50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3006) want to click on the color and we want to turn all the values to one so that it is fully white so now if I control shift and select this color ramp this is going to be the mask of Where The Red parts 
[50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3016) are if I control shift and select the color ramp you can see it is matching up with the same location so I can do the same exact thing so I'm going to click on this color ramp I'll press Ctrl shift 
[50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3026) d and I'm going to drop it up here and then I just want to use the third and fourth so I'll click on this one let's hit the minus to get rid of it and this one here click on the minus to get rid 
[50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3036) of it so then again this one right here we want to make this fully black so that's the third one then here on the fourth one I want to click on this one here and this one I want to make all the 
[50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3046) values to one so the red green and blue to 1 so that it is fully white and this one is going to control the green values if I control shift and select the color amp you can see that's where the green 
[50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3056) values are and if I control shift and select the color ramp you can see the green values are in these large areas and you can just continue to do this as many times as you need so that you 
[51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3066) create masks for all the colors so now I'm going to show you how to mix them all together so what I first want to do is take this color ramp and we're going to put it into a mix to control the 
[51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3075) black and the white colors so let's press shift day I can go to the search and I can search for a mix let's drop this here and then we are working with color values so let's click on the float 
[51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3086) and I can change this to color instead and then I can take the color and I can put that into the factor and again the factor is controlling where it's going to be color a and where it's going to be 
[51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3095) color B so I now want to take the original color ramp and I want to add the same values so let's take this red color I can put it into B and then I can click here on the blue color and I can 
[51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3105) click and drag the color and I can drop the color here into a so now if I control shift and select the mix I can control shift and select between these and you can see the colors are at the 
[51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3115) correct spot because you can see there's that little blue blob there and it's at the same location as this color right so now we can continue to add more and more mixes and we can mix them all together 
[52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3125) so I'm going to click on this mix let's press shift d to duplicate it and I can drop it here so I now want to take this mixed result and I want to put this into color a and then we want to take the 
[52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3136) other color ramp here this is the fact Vector for the green color and let's put the color into the factor so again that's telling it where it's going to be a and where it's going to be B so we can 
[52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3145) now go back here to our original color ramp and we can click on the green color and we can drag and drop the color into color B so click on this mix and press shift d to duplicate it let's drop it 
[52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3155) here and we can take the result and we can put that into color a then we want to take this color ramp here and this is controlling where the purple is going to be so let's take the color I can put 
[52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3165) that into the factor and then I can control shift and select this mix and I want to take this purple color and let's put that into B so it is really hard to see and it actually looks kind of blue 
[52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3175) because it's blending with the green color but if I now hold down the Ctrl and shift key and select between the original color amp and the mix you can see they look exactly the same there is 
[53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3185) no difference so I can now bring the principal Shader up and I can replace this mix for our original color ramp so let's put the result into the base color and then I can control shift and select 
[53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3197) the prince of able to Shader to preview it so now that we've done that I can drag the group input over here and we can plug up all the custom colors so I can just plug these all up here so I'll 
[53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3207) plug up a and b and then also this one here and then also this one here and then of course as I've talked about earlier right over here on the side panel you can rename all these so for 
[53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3217) instance I could just rename this to like color one and I could rename all of the colors so if I now go outside of the node group we have all the different custom colors and while we're on the 
[53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3226) subject of changing the custom colors I want to show you another way to change the custom colors so if I go back here into the node group another way that you can add custom colors is by adding the 
[53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3236) Hue saturation value node so if I just press shift a I'm going to go here to the search I can search for Hue and I'm going to add the Hue saturation value node and I can put this here between the 
[54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3248) mix and the base color so if I bring the group input here I can just drop the Hue in and the saturation and the value and now if I go outside of the node group I can easily really change the Hue which 
[54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3259) is going to change the colors the saturation which will change how colorful the colors are and also the value to make it brighter or darker so those are some really useful custom 
[54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3268) values that you might want to use alright so I've shown you how to convert a color amp to this node setup right here with these other color ramps in the mix and that way we can control the 
[54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3278) colors outside of a node group however if I go back into the node group if I wanted to move the colorant position values around to make the colors more or less contrasty you can see here on the 
[54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3289) color ramp we don't have any of these extra sockets here to control the position value of the tabs so if you want to control the position values of these tabs we can set up some basic 
[54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3299) drivers so just take the group input I'm just going to bring it over here and what I first want to do is just rename all these just so that it's better organized so I now want to create a new 
[55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3307) input here and that input we're going to add a driver which is going to control the position values so right over here on the inputs let's click on color one and then I can click on the plus here 
[55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3317) and that is going to add a new input now we don't want to use a color value so let's click on the type here and we want to change it to float instead because float is going to use number values and 
[55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3328) right here on color one if I double click on this I'm going to call it color one position now because we're going to be using a driver we actually don't want to plug anything up to this color one 
[55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3338) position so if I go outside of the node group we now have this color one position here and this is going to control where this color is so now to create a driver I first want to copy the 
[55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3348) data path so right here on this color one position I want to right click on this and then I want to click on copy data path and just to show you what this is doing I've brought up a text file on 
[56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3360) my computer and I'm going to press Ctrl V to paste what we copied so this data right here this is the text that we copied and this data is what the driver is going to use to know what value is 
[56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3370) going to control the color ramp positions so now that we've right clicked here and copied the data path of this Color Run position I'm going going to tab to go into the node group and for 
[56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3380) the color one that is going to be this color right here so if I drag this around you can see it's more or less contrasty so right here on this black tab what I want to do is add a position 
[56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3388) value right here because that's controlling where the black tab is so I'm going to right click and then we're going to click on ADD driver and then this driver setting will come up and if 
[56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3397) for some reason you move your mouse out of the way and the driver setting goes away you can see this is purple here and that's telling us that it has a driver applied to it so you can just right 
[56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3406) click again and then you can click on edit driver and the driver settings will come back now right here on the type we don't want this to be a scripted expression we want this to be some 
[56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3415) values because we just want to add a number value and then we need to delete this variable and add a new one so that we can change the type of it so I'm going to click on the X here to get rid 
[57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3425) of this variable and then we can click on ADD input variable now right down here on this prop we want to click on this to change the ID type and because we're working with materials we just 
[57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3435) want to change this to material then right here on the drop down there are quite a few materials but I want to add the material which I'm currently using now we have a path and if we click on 
[57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3444) the path we can press Ctrl V and then enter and that is going to paste the data that we copied earlier and then just to make sure it's fully updated you can just click on update dependencies 
[57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3454) and then move your mouse out of the way so if I now hit the Tab Key to go out of the node group we have this color one position and I can drag this around and now if I go back in the node group you 
[57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3464) can see now the position has been moved and this color one position is now controlling the position value of this black tab now if you want to make your material look exactly the same as the 
[57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3473) original color ramp then you need to make sure that these position values are the same as the position values on these color ramps so this one right here this is at the very starting so the position 
[58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3481) value is zero so if I just go outside of the node group this Color Run position I can just turn to zero so I'm now going to do the same thing for color two so I'm going to go into the node group 
[58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3491) let's click here on color two I can click on the plus here because we want to create a new value here or a new input and I want to rename this one to color to position now here on the type I 
[58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3501) want to click on the color and I want to change it to float instead because we just want to use number values so I can now hit the Tab Key to go outside of the node group and we want to right click on 
[58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3510) this and then again we want to click on copy the data path so that we copy the text which is the data of this position value so I can now tab to go into the node group and we want to add the next 
[58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3520) position value to this one right here so this white one so I'm going to click on it and then right here in the position I can right click let's click on ADD driver and then we can do the same thing 
[58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3529) so right here on the type I want to change this to some values because we're working with number values I then want to click on the X here to get rid of this variable and let's click on ADD 
[58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3538) input variable to add a new one and then I want to change the ID type to material so let's click on the prop and I can change it to material and then here on the material drop down we want to select 
[59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3548) the current material that we're using and then on the value here I can press Ctrl V and then hit enter to paste that and then again you can click on update depend Tendencies so now you can see the 
[59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3559) position value has been dragged way over here so what I want to do is Click right here on this second color and you can see the position is 0.336 so I'm going to click on the position press Ctrl C 
[59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3570) and that's going to copy the exact position number then I can hit the tab you do it out of the node group and here on color to position I can click on this and I can press Ctrl V and then enter 
[59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3581) just to paste that so now it looks the same but I can now drag this around and that's going to control the color ramp position and then if you want to you can also hit the Tab Key to go into the node 
[59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3591) group and right here on this color to position I want the default value to be right here so on the color to position right here on the default I can click on this and then press Ctrl V and I can 
[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3601) paste that exact value and this will set the default position to that exact position value on the color to position and right up here on color one position this one I want the default value to be 
[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3611) zero because it's over here on this side so you can just continue to do that for as many as you want so you could just do the black ones here but you could also change it for the white ones as well and 
[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3621) you could just continue to do that for all of them I'm just going to do it one more time in this video but in your own time you could add drivers for any of these position values so let's add the 
[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3629) next one so here on color three I can click on this and then I can click on the plus here to add a new input then on the type here again I want to change it to float and then I want to rename the 
[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3638) position so I can now tab to go outside the node group and here's the color 3 position so I want to right click on this and I want to click on copy data path so I can now go back into the node 
[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3650) group so I'm going to click on the white one and then right click on the position and I can click on ADD driver and then right here in the type we want to change this to some values and then let's 
[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3660) delete the variable and add a new variable and then here on the ID type let's change this to material and then again we want to select the current material and then here on the path you 
[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3671) can press Ctrl V to paste that data and then hit enter and then you can click on update dependencies now you can see again this has been moved over so if I go right down here I want to click on 
[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3682) this color right here because that's where the position was and for this one I want to hover my mouse over the position value and I want to press Ctrl C to copy that value then I can hit the 
[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3692) Tab Key to go out of the node group and here on color 3 position I can hover my mouse over that position and press Ctrl V to paste it so now we can control that position and also if I go back into the 
[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3704) node group here on color 3 position here on the default value I will press Ctrl V to paste that value so again you could continue to do that for this one here and also this one over here and this one 
[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3715) and you could just continue to do it for as many of the position values that you have alright so for my next example here I just set up a very basic material so I just have the texture coordinate and 
[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3725) mapping with the object coordinates then I have this noise texture and then I have the noise texture going into the color ramp and the color ramp is going into the roughness and so this way some 
[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3736) parts are more shiny and other parts are more rough and I can drag these colorant values around to make it more shiny or more rough so just earlier in this video I showed you how to add drivers to the 
[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3746) position values if you want to move these values around but there's actually another node which acts similar to the color ramp which you can use in replace of the color ramp and that way you don't 
[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3756) have to add any drivers and there are many cases where you still may want to use a color ramp but let me show you this other node so if I press shift a and go to the search I can search for 
[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3766) the map range node and let's drop this here and then I'm going to plug the factor into the value of this map range and then I can replace the result for this color Amper here so I'm going to 
[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3777) put it into the roughness so when I did that you can see it looks a little bit different but I can now drag these minimum and maximum values of the map range and that's going to act similar to 
[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3787) a color Ram so I'm actually going to hold down the shift key to make my movements more sensitive and I can drag these values around and you can see it's acting similar to the color app because 
[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3796) it's making the values more contrasty so in many of your node setups if you want to control a color ramp outside of a node group it may be easier just to switch out a color ramp for a map range 
[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3806) node however there are many cases where you would still want to use a color ramp a few examples of this are if you want to have many different tabs so let's say that I want to have like a mid gray 
[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3815) color I could hold down the control key click here to add a tab and then I could make this like a mid gray color and I could drag this around and it just gives you a little bit more control also if 
[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3825) you want to change the different colors you could make like a blue color or like a red color and you can have many different colors and also another reason why you may want to use a color ramp is 
[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3833) if you're using some of these other interpolations so for instance there's like a b spline here and this is going to change the fade between the two tabs or you may want it to be constant so if 
[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3843) I change this to the constant now it's going to be super sharp now if you are using custom colors and you want to use a map range what you can do is press shift a you can go to the search and you 
[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3854) can search for a mix node I'm going to drop this up here and I want to click on the float and I want to change it to color so that we're using Color values and then I want the map range result to 
[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3864) be going into the factor so then I can put the mixed result into the principal Shader and I will Ctrl shift and select the principle Shader so I can now just make two colors here for the mix so I'm 
[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3875) going to make maybe like a blue color and a red color and then here on the minimum and maximum values on the map range I can drag this around and I can make it more contrasty I can also drag 
[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3885) the two Max and the 2 Min if I want to make it even sharper and to be able to see more of the blue I need to turn the from minimum up so I'll turn that way up so it's a bit sharper so as you can see 
[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3895) the map range node does act very similar to a color ramp so there may be many cases where you can just get rid of the color ramp and use the map range instead and while using the map range can be a 
[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3905) lot easier for creating custom node groups is because I can box select all the nodes I can press Ctrl G to join it together into a node group and then we just have these values here that which 
[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3915) we can plug into the group input whereas the color ramp doesn't have those values to control so I could put this one right up here and then let me play around with some of these other ones I think I want 
[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3925) to control that one so I'll put that up there so then outside of the node group if I make this bigger I could drag this around it's basically doing the same thing as the drivers on a color ramp 
[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3934) alright so the next thing I'm going to show you is how to control roughness values and so for an example material I've created this very basic material it just has a noise texture going into the 
[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3944) roughness and then I have the metallic turned up and I have the base color kind of dark so we basically have this nice metal material so I'm just going to box select these nodes and then I'll press 
[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3954) Ctrl G to join it together into a node group so now if I go inside the node group let's say I want to control the roughness well if your material has one single roughness value then you probably 
[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3965) don't have any texture plugged up to the roughness so I could just plug the roughness here into the group input and then outside of the node group I could easily drag around the roughness however 
[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3974) with many materials you are probably using some sort of texture in the roughness and adding a texture makes it look very cool because it makes some parts more rough and other parts more 
[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3983) shiny and so if I want to control the roughness value but I have a texture which is going into the roughness then what I can do is just change the brightness and the Darkness because if I 
[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=3992) press shift a go to the search if I just search for a color ramp right here and drop this here if I drag the black tabs out there's going to be more black and so it's going to be more shiny however 
[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4003) if I drag the white out it's going to be more rough so I'm just going to delete this color ramp and I'll plug the Factor up to the roughness so there's a really great node which we can use to change 
[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4012) the brightness and the Darkness so if I press shift a and go here to the search I can search for the Hue saturation value and I can just put this before the roughness so this value here is going to 
[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4024) make the texture brighter or darker and so we can just stick this here right before it goes into the roughness and then we can control how rough and shiny the material is but it is still using 
[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4034) the texture of the noise so then I can take the value and I can put that right in here to the extra socket let me press the end key to open the side panel this was the old roughness value that we're 
[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4044) not using so I can hit the minus to get rid of it and then this value the value that you've plugged into the group input we can just double click on this and I can just rename it to roughness so then 
[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4053) outside of the node group I can drag this around and it's still using the texture but it'll make the metal more rough or more shiny so that's a really easy way to control the roughness value 
[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4062) if you are using a texture in the roughness and you could use this same method for making any values lighter or dark worker so for another example I have this material here and this has a 
[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4072) noise texture and it is eventually going into the emission strength so that some of the material is actually emitting light but if I wanted to easily control the brightness of the light I could 
[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4082) press shift a go to the search and I could search for the Hue saturation value and let's put this here before it goes into the emission strength and then this value is going to make it lighter 
[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4092) or darker then I can put the value here into the group input and I could just call this like brightness and then outside of the node group I have this brightness value that I can drag around 
[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4101) alright for my next example I've added in my procedural rocky planet material again links in the description if you'd like to check out this material but for this example I've deleted all of the 
[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4112) bump sliders so if you want to control the bump or the normal of the material you can go into the node group and you can simply plug all the bump strengths up to the group input so I'm just going 
[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4123) to click on the group input and drag it over here so that it is closer and then you can take all the bumps strengths and you can drag it right in here into the extra socket now this material has many 
[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4133) different layers of bump so if I wanted all of them to be controlled by one single value I could take the bump strength and I could put that all into the same socket however if I do that 
[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4143) just note that it's going to use the same strength value for all the different bump strings so now if I go outside of the node group I have this strength here and I can make it more 
[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4152) bumpy or less bumpy I'm just going to press Ctrl Z though to undo that or if I wanted to control them all individually I could just add them here into a new socket and add them all into the new 
[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4164) sockets here and then I could just rename all the strings and so in this final rocky planet material I have four different bump strengths so I have the bump strength of the mountain also of 
[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4174) the smaller craters then also the land detail and then finally the large craters now if you want to control the displacement of a material for an example I've added in my Rock cave wall 
[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4185) again links in the description if you'd like to check out material and I have this displacement strength slider to make the displacement more and less strong and to control the displacement 
[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4195) if you go into the node group you just need to take your displacement scale and you need to put that into the group input and then you can just drag this around to control the displacement so 
[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4206) I'm now going to show you how to make sliders more and less sensitive and for an example I'm going to be using my procedural Moss material so right here on this Moss Factor gradient we have 
[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4216) this dot scale and I can turn this up or turn it down if I want to make those dots bigger or smaller on the texture although with the dot scale I have to drag it way up to like 100 to make it 
[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4226) very small and all the way down just to maybe like a five if I want those dots to be very big and if I compare that to like this dots detail I can just drag this between 0 and 1 to quickly change 
[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4237) that so if I want to make this slider more sensitive there is an easy way to do that so I'm just going to go into the node group so what you can do is you can just go to whatever wire is plugged up 
[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4247) to the value you which you want to make more sensitive or less sensitive and the one that I'm going to be using is the dot scale right here so what you can do is you can add a math node and you can 
[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4258) use the math node to make the numbers more and less sensitive so I'm going to press shift a I'm going to go to the search and I'm going to search for a math node and I want to put the math 
[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4266) node here between the dot scale and the other texture now I actually want to take the dot scale and I want to put that into the bottom value right here now if you want to make the values more 
[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4277) sensitive we just need to multiply the values so right here on this ad I want to click on this and I want to change it to multiply and then this value here is how much it's going to be multiplied so 
[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4288) for an example I'll just start out with 10 so if I change it to 10 now if I go outside of the node group I have this dot scale and I can just drag this around and it's much more sensitive now 
[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4298) because if I turn the dots detail way down let's say I turn it down to like one you can see how big the dots are then if I turn this up you can see very quickly just by turning this up up to 
[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4308) like a value of 8 those dots get very small whereas if I go back into the node group if I click on this multiply and press the m key that's going to mute the node so it's basically canceling the 
[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4319) effect of the node if I wanted to drag this way out and make the dot smaller I'd have to drag this way out to a really big number like a hundred so click on the multiply I'm going to press 
[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4329) the m key to unmute it so this multiply is going through the dot scale and so it's multiplying the value by a value of 10 and so that is making this dot scale much more sensitive and you can do the 
[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4341) same thing if you want to make it less sensitive so for an example I have this gradient scale and you can see I don't drag the gradient scale very much the gradient scale right now is turned to 
[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4352) one or if I want to make it smaller I could just turn the gradient scale up to like three and you can see now the gradient is even smaller and I can drag it even just up to like a six or a seven 
[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4361) and the size of that gradient is very small so if I want to have this be less sensitive one way that I could very easily do do this is just by holding down the shift key and then dragging the 
[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4371) value and that's going to make the movements more sensitive but let's say that I didn't want to drag that around what I can do is just add a math node and do the same thing but we are going 
[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4379) to divide the values instead of multiply so I'm going to go here into the node group and then right here we have the gradient scale so I'm going to press shift a I'm going to go to the search 
[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4389) and I'm going to search for the math node and we want to put the math node right here in the wire after the gradient scale to make it less sensitive I want to click on the add here and I 
[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4398) want to change it to divide instead and then you want to take the gradient scale or whatever value you're using and you want to put that into the bottom socket and then for this example I'm going to 
[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4409) turn the Divide Top Value to a value of 30. so now if I go outside of the node group we have this gradient scale and I can drag this around and you can see it is much less sensitive so now if I want 
[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4421) to make the gradient scale very big I have to turn this all the way up to like 45 or 50 and then if I want to make this very small I have to turn it all the way down to like a value of five so that is 
[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4432) how to make values more or less sensitive just by using these math nodes and changing the values all right so for my next example I've added in my procedural lava material and in this 
[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4443) example I'm going to show you how to add a value which will blend between two materials so in this example here in this lava material if I go inside the material I have this emission here and 
[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4453) that is the actual brightness of the lava that's the lava being emitted and then this principled Shader here that is just the rock Shader so if I control shift and select this you can see it's 
[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4463) just a basic Rock Shader but if I control shift and select this that is the lava Shader and so I am joining these two different shaders together with this mix Shader Now to control 
[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4473) where it's going to be one Shader and where it's going to be the other Shader I have this noise texture here and then I have this color ramp to make it more contrasty and that is going into the 
[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4481) factor of the mix Shader now if I control shift and select this color ramp this color ramp is controlling where it's going to be be the Rock and where it's going to be the lava and so you can 
[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4490) say I can drag this black tab around and if I control shift and select the mix Shader that's going to blend between using more of the Rock and more the lava so earlier in this video I did show you 
[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4501) how to add a basic driver to the position and so if you wanted to control how much it's lava and how much is Rock you could go back to that part with the timestamps in the description and you 
[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4510) could add a driver to this position value however there's actually a much easier way to do this so this color ramp is going to make it brighter or darker so if we can just control the brightness 
[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4521) and darkness of this Factor value that's going to control how much it's going to be Rock and how much it's going to be Lava so I can press shift a I can go to the search and I'm going to search for 
[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4530) the Hue saturation value and in this case the Hue saturation value Works a bit better if I put it before the color ramp because the color ramp is controlling the contrast and so if I put 
[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4539) it after the color ramp it doesn't work quite as well but you can play around with this so you might want to put a hue saturation value here after the color ramp and now if I drag the Val value you 
[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4548) can see it is going to change it but it's not really working how I want it's just kind of making the lava brighter or darker whereas this Hue saturation value this one is before the color amp so if I 
[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4558) drag around this value now it's going to control how much of the rock you can actually see so you might need to put it before or after the color ramp you can just try both and see which one you like 
[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4567) better so I don't need this one here so with the Hue saturation value selected I can press Ctrl X and that's going to get rid of it but it'll keep the wires plugged up I'm just going to use this 
[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4578) one instead so I can now take the value of the Hue saturation value and I can put that here into the group input and then just like all the other values if you press the N key to open up the side 
[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4588) panel you can rename this so if I go outside of the node group I now have this lava amount here and so I can just drag this to make more lava or more rock alright for my next example I've just 
[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4599) created a basic material with a principled Shader and then I have this magic texture and the magic texture is going into the base color and I'm using this magic texture because I'm want to 
[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4608) show you how you can control a value which doesn't have a socket that you can use so I've added this together into a node group I've renamed it to Magic texture but here on the magic texture we 
[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4618) have this really cool depth value but unfortunately this magic texture depth doesn't have a DOT here that we can put into the group input and so if you've watched the earlier part of the video 
[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4627) where I add a driver to control the colorant positions we're going to do the exact same thing for this magic depth so right here on the group input what we can do is click on the plus here to 
[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4638) create a new input and then I can click on this to rename it and I can rename it to Magic depth so if I go outside of the node group this magic depth doesn't have anything plugged up to it so it's not 
[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4648) affecting the material so what I want to do is copy the data path just like we did earlier for the color ramp Driver part of this video so I'm going to right click on this and then I want to click 
[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4658) on the copy data path and when you copy the data path what it's going to do is it's going to copy this value here so this bit of text here is what we copied when we right clicked here and clicked 
[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4669) on copy data path so we can now add the basic driver so if I just go into the node group we just want to add a driver to the depth so I can right click and then let's click on ADD driver now right 
[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4680) here on the type we are working with number values so here on the type we want to change this to some values and then what we want to do is delete the variable and add a new one so I can 
[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4689) click on the X here to get rid of this let's click on ADD input variable and here on the prop we can click on this to change the ID type and we want to change this to material because we're working 
[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4700) with materials then here on the drop down there are quite a few materials here that I've added in the blend file but you just want to select the material which you are currently using so that is 
[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4709) this one here now we have the path here and this is where we're going to paste the data that we copied so if I click on the path I can press Ctrl V then hit enter to paste that and then you can 
[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4719) just click on the update dependencies button so now if I hit the Tab Key to go out of the node group this magic depth is going to control the depth of the magic texture so right here at the end 
[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4728) of the video I want to show you how you can use your custom node setups in other blender projects because this is a question that I very often get in the comments of my videos so people will 
[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4738) follow one of my tutorials or maybe create their own procedural material but then they're wondering how they can use it in another blender file and there's actually three different methods for 
[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4747) using a procedural material in another blender file so a really easy way to do this is to just append in the material data so what you can do is just open up the new blender file that you want to 
[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4757) add the material in and then you can click here on file and you can click on append then what you can do is just locate to the blender file that you've saved which has the material and as an 
[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4768) example I'm going to go here to my procedural chunky rock material so I'm going to double click on this blend file and then what you can do is you can choose what you want to append now in 
[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4778) this case we want to append materials so let's go into the material folder and then I want to click on the procedural chunky Rock and I can click on a pen and now that the data has been added into 
[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4788) this blend file you can go here to the materials click on the drop down and here is the procedural chunky rock that I've just appended in now the second way to do this is to just copy and paste an 
[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4799) object from one blender file to another blender file so over here I have one blender file and then right over here here's the other blender file and this one has my procedural mud material so 
[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4809) what you can just do is Select an object which has the procedural mud material on it you can then press Ctrl C and that is going to copy the object and then if you click over here on the other blender 
[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4818) file on the other side of my screen I can press Ctrl V and that is going to paste that object and if I click on this object you can see it has the procedural mud material and we don't actually need 
[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4829) this object so I'll just hit X and then delete but now we have that procedural mud in the blender file because we copied over the object so if I click on this object here I can click on the drop 
[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4839) down and here's the procedural mode material so I now have this material in this blender file but if you're very consistently using many any different procedural materials that you've created 
[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4850) then the best way to do this is to add the materials as Assets in blender's asset browser and this is where my ultimate procedural material pack comes in so in my ultimate blender procedural 
[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4860) material pack I've added all of my procedural materials and they're all pre-set up in blender's asset browser and they all have custom thumbnails and they've all been sorted into these 
[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4870) different catalogs here so you can easily find what you're looking for so I could go right down here and I could click on the ground catalog it's going to show me all the ground materials and 
[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4879) then let's say I want to use this dirt material I can just drag the dirt material from the asset browser and I can drop it onto my object and then all of my procedural materials in my 
[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4888) procedural material pack has been added as customizable materials so once you drop in a material you can just open up the Shader editor and there's all the different customizable settings so you 
[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51jdmRvyImk&t=4898) can quickly change the material for each use now if you'd like to learn how to set up your own materials in the asset browser then you can check out my tutorial on how to use the asset browser

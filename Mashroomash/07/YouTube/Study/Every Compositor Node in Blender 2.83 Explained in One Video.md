(Description:: Every single node in Blender 2.83's compositor, explained in one video. The compositor works with both Cycles and EEVEE. It allows you to change colors, add depth of field, even texture models after the render is done. While it's recommended that you avoid the phrase "Fix it in post," sometimes, it cannot be avoided. Learn how to navigate those situations, with a whole new arsenal of nodes under your belt! Blender 2.83 Compositing nodes!)

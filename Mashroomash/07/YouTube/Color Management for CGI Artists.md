(Description:: Color management is one of those intimidating aspects of digital image-making, that we all just have to be part of one way or another. I feel like most artists are walking in the dark when it comes to working with colors, so I thought I would make a digestible video that hopefully will help clear some things out. You're not going to learn all about color-management here, but hopefully it'll clear some of the confusion surrounding it.)

1. - [8]  Wonder [02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KV28Lkd2DU&list=WL&index=53&t=174) 
	- This step is about exploring what got you interested in 3D maybe you saw some cool Motion Graphics or maybe a sweet animation on the big screen whatever it is find what inspired you and use this time to document that.
	- Once you've gathered all your inspiration put it into a folder or a mood board, somewhere easily accessible because we're going to need it for step two. 
2. - [8] Analyze [03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=213&v=4KV28Lkd2DU) 
	- now I'd want to look over each of my Inspirations and start asking myself what do I think I want to pursue from these 
	- Maybe I really like the cell shaded textures from Jet Set Radio or maybe I'd want to learn about environment art from Skyrim.
	- Now we're going to combine these with step three.

> Everyone starts their Journey here at Rock Bottom knowing nothing about blender then they jump into the chaos thinking yeah I'll learn modeling they follow some tutorials learn the basics and their confidence is Sky High, they think they know it all, but as time goes on they learn new Concepts like subd modeling, Edge flow, topology, hard surface this overwhelming amount of new knowledge kicks them down here to What's called *the valley of Despair* - this is the Trap. This is where most people give up or worse yet start the cycle again.

#### The map method
[08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KV28Lkd2DU&list=WL&index=53&t=463)
1. ***Muster*** - here we want to find all our inspiration and dump it into this theoretical bucket.
2. ***Assess*** - identify all the tools and skills used for each piece of inspiration.
3. ***Plot*** - with your why statement at ready we want to match all these different skills to it.
If any of them don't align with this sentence get rid of it.

### Step 3 - Quest
[09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KV28Lkd2DU&list=WL&index=53&t=579) We need to plot out our quests or in other words choose our goals [10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KV28Lkd2DU&list=WL&index=53&t=646). So how do we figure this out like what's the best way to set our goals [11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KV28Lkd2DU&list=WL&index=53&t=671)? Well there's two options:
`````col

````
````col-md
flexGrow=1

````
`````
#### The first method
[11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KV28Lkd2DU&list=WL&index=53&t=683)
`````col
````col-md
flexGrow=1

````
````col-md
flexGrow=1
===
![[Screenshot_20240709-013938_YouTube.jpg]]
````
`````
1. ***Define*** - here we just want to set up a list of clear and specific goals. And since we already have the *thing* we want to learn, the *skill* we want to pursue and the *reason* why. This part is so so easy.
	- I'd recommend making five goals to start with.
`````col
````col-md
flexGrow=1
===
![[Screenshot_20240709-005553_YouTube.jpg]]

````
````col-md
flexGrow=1
===
![[Screenshot_20240709-005706_YouTube.jpg]]
````
`````
2. ***Why***  - ask yourself why you want to achieve these goals. Here's just a few questions to help you figure it out.

.Question: What will achieving this do for me?
.You: I will be proud of myself.
.Question: What excites me about this?
.You: I like to see beautiful art
.Question: What will happen if I don't achieve this goal?
.You: This will be just another thing that I gave up on.

>> [!warning] The reason is most likely going to be very similar to your main reason for learning blender, that's fine, do the exercise anyway. Because having a deep understanding of the reason for your goal is so important! It's honestly Priceless. 

3. ***Action plan*** - simply put this is just planning the path to achieving the goal.
	- The easiest thing to do is just work backwards and figure out each major Milestone.
4. ***Deadline*** - it not only creates this sense of urgency, but it also helps you build out a timeline. This way you're not going to take like 15 years to do the goal.

````
`````
5. ***Review*** - Our goals shouldn't be these meaningless tasks, but they also shouldn't be these insane unachievable ones. This stage is all about reviewing and adjusting your goals regularly. *Like once a month*, so doing this not only makes the goal easier, but it usually makes it faster to achieve as well.

### Step 1 - Play
`````col

Build a game that would actually be fun to play: I'm talking XP, level, UPS, achievement unlocks. And we do this by setting up a simple structure like this. 
Each box represents something different: habits, daily tasks, major goals, rewards.
All you need to do now is fill these out. And because we have our map from level one, we can basically just copy paste a lot of this stuff into it. 
So for example my boxes would look something like this. And if I reach a goal I'd get a set amount of XP and gold or if I do a habit like open blender I get an XP Point.

>>[!Warning] If we try to rush the process or worse yet cheat the system one of two things will happen: you'll burn out or you'll quit.

> That's why this step is called Advance - we don't want to Blitz to the end and pretend like we're a pro, we want to advance through the stages of our goal so that we can become the person who can achieve that goal.

Spend some time doing the absolute fundamentals preferably in this order: 
- Blender Basics 
- Niche fundamentals 
- Intermediate Concepts 

And after about a week of initial blender experience I'd look at my goals and see if my path needs to be adjusted. Every week following that I'd do it again. 
And around this point in the process your path should be really solid, which means we're ready to learn the next Concept in the blueprint.

> 1. Find a subject
> 2. Use it with your Niche
> 3. Give yourself a constraint

This combination limits what you can do because I mean you got a week, it's not a lot of time.
But having this combination is actually what allows you to do the project in a week. If you're really struggling to figure out what you want to do just steal some ideas.

> [!info] The main thing is to just do the project with the skills you have, problem solve as you go and only watch tutorials if you really need them.

### Step 4 - Synergy
>> [!tldr] Now we should be pretty deep into our map but now the problem becomes how do we close this remaining gap between here and our goal. The pathway is shorter but the challenges are way harder. Well, the answer is skill trees. [26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KV28Lkd2DU&list=WL&index=53&t=1573)

 Wee need to show it off and build something for ourselves and this is exactly what step one is all about. Building a name for yourself online especially as an artist isn't easy, whether it's getting discovered or even just posting your work. But doing this exercise of showing your stuff online is one of the best things you can do to increase your skill.

At this stage our map should be pretty much complete. But remember that trap I mentioned in level one? Once you're in this stage of the blueprint you're technically in another trap and it's this peak here we've successfully climbed out of the first trap but now we're in this weird intersection where our progress plateaus. So what to do?

1. ***Find*** - when we find something new in 3D it's pretty common that you want to try it out. This step is all about that all you got to do is find or learn a new method that lets you create something awesome.
2. ***Operate*** - with this new found knowledge we want to now create the thing and it could literally be anything.
3. ***Reveal*** - showing our work is super important, but doing this with the forge system is completely different. We're not looking for pity likes or follows, we're looking for specific feedback along the lines of "oh my God how did you do that". The moment you see this or even if you don't, it's time to initiate step four.
4. ***Grow*** - with our new creation we want to break it down and explain exactly how we did it. We're not doing this for attention, we're doing this to solidify the new technique and grow our skill set. If you can't explain a method or concept easily. it's probably because you don't understand it yourself.
5. ***Evolve*** - now that we've done this once, all we want to do is repeat.

(Description:: A good understanding of topology is a vital skill that every VFX artist should have in their arsenal. In this video, I'll break down a quick and simple method to change the edge count of any topology. Once you know how to connect an odd and an even number of faces, you can create clean topology for any mesh.)

[00:00](https://youtu.be/HGL6QpVRyXk?si=MI0elM3ks7JAT3fa&t=0) hello guys my name's Rob this channel is called decoded and today I'm going to show you the only method you'll ever need to solve any topology problem bad understanding of topology is the number 
[00:42](https://youtu.be/HGL6QpVRyXk?si=MI0elM3ks7JAT3fa&t=42) The problem
let's say we have a standard cube here and it doesn't really matter what this is it's not gonna make a lot of sense

[01:08](https://youtu.be/HGL6QpVRyXk?si=MI0elM3ks7JAT3fa&t=68) in theory no problem we've modeled what we want to model the problem is now the topology is ruined we've added these lip cuts all the way around the entire mesh if these were fingers on the end of a person's arm and character's arm then you now would have added these little cuts going all the way up the arm that would be going potentially up to the head they'd be going all over the model right.

**so how we solve this** [02:03](https://youtu.be/HGL6QpVRyXk?si=MI0elM3ks7JAT3fa&t=123)

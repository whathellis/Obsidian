(Description:: The original creator asks to please not use this portfolio exactly. Apply what you learn and create a unique UI and model movements rather than copying the exact structure of his site. The purpose of this video is not to copy his portfolio, but to provide the knowledge to develop an award-winning website. I recommend making something that is meaningful to you, like a train station you always visit or a garden etc.! . Credit: https://bokoko33.me/  |  https://twitter.com/bokoko33 )
Special thanks to @maisyleigh  letting me use her office reference for the model!

**2/18/2023 UPDATE** ScrollTrigger.matchmedia is now DEPRECATED. Now you can use  gsap matchmedia instead (it is nearly identical setup to the ScrollTrigger match media we use in the video; just a different syntax): https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.matchMedia(). This also affects the preloader section since you no longer have to emit to check or use window matchmedia, you can just use the gsap match media there as well (you don't have to, but it'll be cleaner and less code).
**7/16/2022 UPDATE** If you're watching this now you'll be using Vite 3.0+ and your starter code will look a little different. Not too big of a deal, just remove the unnecessary files. 

 I ACTUALLY CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!! THANK YOU!!! 11,000 subscribers! You're all amazing!

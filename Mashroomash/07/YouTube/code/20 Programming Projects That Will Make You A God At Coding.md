[00:00](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=0) you know what's cool about knowing how to code you can build whatever you [Music] want but the problem for a lot of people is they don't know what to build I have 
[00:10](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=10) this problem all the time I want to program something but I don't know what I get that random 3:00 a.m. motivation where I'm ready to program but then I just stare at my computer screen and 
[00:19](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=19) then Google programming project and then I'm looking at page after page trying to find out what to make and then I end up on YouTube where I watch top 10 programming projects get a job now 
[00:30](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=30) by the time I think of something I don't want to code anymore my motivation is gone and I'm back to watching brain Rock content this kept happening to me until I found this GitHub repo about a year 
[00:39](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=39) ago and I wish I knew about it earlier build your own x x as in the letter X not ex that'd be a little weird but with today's AI you could do that too oh I can see why it's an amazing GitHub 
[00:51](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=51) repository it says right here that it's a compilation of well-written step-by-step guides for recreating our favorite Technologies from scratch check out how cool some of these projects are 
[01:00](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=60) you have a 3D renderer augmented reality games crypto and blockchain so you can make your own disgusting meme coins and look you can even make your own terrible JavaScript framework wait wait wait 
[01:10](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=70) those projects seem hard sloth I only know how to do a for loop from my JavaScript sorry about that to me that sounded like skill issues no but seriously though a lot of you that watch 
[01:20](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=80) my terrible videos are in fact beginners so I thought hey why don't I create my own programming project video totally original which is why today I'm here to share sloth top uh 20 programming 
[01:32](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=92) projects yeah I'm going to list out project ideas that go from beginner intermediate Advanced and then 10x developer I already shared five projects on sloth bites and gave some reason oh 
[01:44](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=104) you don't know what sloth bites is sloth bites is a Weekly Newsletter where I share bite-sized programming information to make you a better programmer for free except for your email but don't worry 
[01:54](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=114) about that and it currently has over 900 subscribers my goal is to make sloth bites one of the top newsletters for programming so cough up that email and subscribe right now okay let's start off 
[02:04](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=124) with number one a portfolio yeah we're starting really basic but stay with me now a portfolio is one of the easiest projects you can do it's just a place that shows off your work and experience 
[02:14](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=134) which means if you're a total beginner you get to do absolutely nothing because you don't have work experience you lose all you really need is HTML and CSS and those aren't even programming languages 
[02:24](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=144) but if you want to get fancy you can use JavaScript I'm going to rate the portfolio a 1 out of 10 for difficulty a zero out of 10 for resume worthy because bro this is basically your resume I'll 
[02:33](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=153) give it a 2 out of 10 for learning value because you'll learn the basics of HTML and CSS and then I'll give it a 3 out of 10 for coolness it depends on how good you are at styling why coolness because 
[02:42](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=162) it's my video I can do whatever I want second project is build your own git this is a 10x developer project what you thought these projects were going to be sorted based off difficulty I already 
[02:51](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=171) told you this is my video so I make up the git is a Version Control tool that every developer uses hopefully it was created by our Lord and savior lus T vaults and it basically revolutionized 
[03:02](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=182) how we manage code building your own version of git will make you learn a lot like what the heck the git directory is git objects and more plus you'll get some respect from other programmers for 
[03:11](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=191) actually knowing how version control works outrate this project a 7 out of 10 for difficulty a 6 out of 10 for resume worthy because jobs really won't care about this too much unless it's an 
[03:21](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=201) actual engineer reviewing it but it's still a pretty impressive project a 9 out of 10 for learning value because you're going to learn a lot about how git works and a 4 out of 10 for coolness 
[03:29](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=209) because only programmers will understand how cool it is third project is a to-do list app this is a beginner project and it's as basic as it can get but hey it's a start I might even call this one the 
[03:40](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=220) hello world of web development projects if you want to start learning web development this Project's for you you'll get to learn a lot of the basics for JavaScript or PHP if you use that 
[03:49](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=229) hey I don't judge I'll give this project a 2 out of 10 for difficulty a 2 out of 10 for resume worthy because it's a step up from the portfolio at least a 4 out of 10 for learning value because you're 
[03:58](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=238) going to learn fundamental web dev Concepts and a 4 out of 10 for coolness because people love a to-do list fourth project is an AI girlfriend or boyfriend that's so stupid with recent 
[04:09](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=249) improvements of AI you can take advantage and make this unique project you can make a website or app that connects to some language model like gp4 Gemini llama whatever AIS exist and then 
[04:20](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=260) give the AI some prompt to act like the loving partner you wish you had you can add some AI character that does mouth movements and then you can add some premium features and Bam you're rich off 
[04:29](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=269) of people's loneliness good job I'll rate this project a 6 out of 10 for difficulty a 7 out of 10 for resume worthy maybe a 10 out of 10 depending on if the recruiter is lonely and then I'll 
[04:39](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=279) give it a 6 out of 10 for learning value because you'll learn how to make AI apps and then I'll give it a negative 1 out of 10 for coolness I think you know why fifth project a smart mirror this is an 
[04:49](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=289) intermediate project where you're going to build a smart mirror that's going to display stuff like the weather the news your calendar maybe even add an AI assistant this project combines both 
[04:57](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=297) software and Hardware so it's a good project if you like messing around with things like a Raspberry Pi I'll rate this project a 5 out of 10 for difficulty a 6 out of 10 for resume 
[05:06](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=306) worthy because it's a pretty unique project that combines hardware and software an 8 out of 10 for learning value because you get to learn how to integrate hardware and software and a 10 
[05:15](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=315) out of 10 for coolness because it's a smart mirror that you made that's pretty cool project number six a personal finance tracker this is an intermediate project that's going to track your 
[05:24](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=324) expenses and then you can use some chart library to visualize it you can turn this project into an advanced one if you integrate a third party like plaid to get actual banking information I'll rate 
[05:34](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=334) this project a 4 out of 10 for difficulty a 5 out of 10 if you use plaid and then I'll give it a 5 out of 10 for resume worthy because it shows you know how to visualize data with 
[05:42](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=342) graphs and charts and the business World Loves graphs and charts I'll give it a 5 out of 10 for learning value because you'll get to learn a lot about data visualization and then I'll give it a 5 
[05:51](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=351) out of 10 for coolness maybe an 8 out of 10 for the finance Bros project number seven a calculator this is another classic beginner project to to teach you the fundamentals and it's pretty 
[06:01](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=361) straightforward add stuff subtract stuff multiply stuff divide stuff you get the point you can make it more challenging by adding stuff like exponents s cosine negative numbers really whatever you 
[06:12](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=372) want to add I'll give this project a 2 out of 10 for difficulty a 2 out of 10 for resume worthy it's a calculator not rocket science nobody's going to Care three out of 10 for learning value 
[06:22](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=382) because you'll still learn some fundamentals and then I'll give it a 2 out of 10 for coolness it's something these ratings are honestly useless because they're just random numbers like 
[06:30](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=390) project number eight build your own neural network this is an advanced project and I mentioned this one in sloth bites oh you don't know what sloth B is if you want to go into machine 
[06:39](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=399) learning or AI neural networks are a must know so building your own is a really good way to understand how most of these fancy AI work and bonus points if you do it from scratch without any 
[06:48](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=408) libraries because the math for Concepts like back propagation is um yeah I'll give this project a 7 out of 10 for difficulty a 4 out of 10 for resume worthy because unfortunately not many 
[06:59](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=419) people people care if you do this unless you're like in your first year of college I'll give it a 9 out of 10 for learning value it's painful but you'll have a really good understanding for 
[07:07](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=427) popular AI technology and then I'll give it a 9 out of 10 for coolness because you can basically say I made my own Ai and that's pretty cool project number nine a realtime chat application this is 
[07:18](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=438) an intermediate project and sure there's plenty of chat applications out there but you didn't make them making this app is a pretty good project to learn about real time tools like websockets and it's 
[07:28](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=448) a pretty good project that will take you from beginner to intermediate because it has all the parts a front end a backend a database and now websockets I'll give this project a 4 out of 10 for 
[07:37](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=457) difficulty a 5 out of 10 for resumé worthy it's surprisingly a good resumé project for how common it is a 7 out of 10 for learning value because you get to learn about how real time stuff works 
[07:48](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=468) and then I'll give it a 7 out of 10 for coolness because real time is pretty sweet and satisfying project number 10 build your own reddis this is another 10x developer project reddis is an 
[07:58](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=478) inmemory database which means it mainly uses your computer's Ram so you'll basically be building your own database yeah that's 10x developer worthy but it'll be really difficult building your 
[08:08](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=488) own Reddit from scratch will really give you a deep dive on how complex databases are I'll give this project a 9 out of 10 for difficulty an 8 out of 10 for resume worthy it's pretty impressive a 10 out 
[08:19](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=499) of 10 for learning value you'll have a deep understanding of reddis and databases and then I'll give it a 5 out of 10 for coolness because it's another project that only programmers will care 
[08:28](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=508) about and you know what's pretty cool remember that build your own X repo I mentioned if you look right there you'll see this thing called build your own reddis wow I wonder where I got this 
[08:37](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=517) idea so if you click it you'll get sent to a website called Cod Crafters Cod Crafters is an amazing website that will guide you through these complex projects and they were kind enough to sponsor 
[08:46](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=526) this video their goal is to help programmers by providing a detailed step-by-step guide on how to start complex projects and these guides were created by experienced Engineers that 
[08:55](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=535) are probably smarter than you and me but you'll still have to figure out the code itself which ensures you don't get stuck in tutorial hell you can build your own redus git Docker sqlite and a lot of 
[09:05](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=545) other Technologies from scratch these are all 10x developer level projects and they'll guide you through every step of the way which will make you an amazing programmer you'll gain a deep 
[09:13](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=553) understanding for each of the Technologies because they'll also teach you the fundamental concepts that made these Technologies possible not only that but every month they make multiple 
[09:21](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=561) projects free so you can check it out and see if you like it I highly recommend Cod crafters and if you want to tackle these Advanced projects and become a 10x developer click the link in 
[09:29](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=569) the description and you'll get 40% off you're welcome all right project number 11 a random quote generator this is a really simple program where it's just going to display a random quote when 
[09:40](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=580) something happens or when the page loads um you can use this project to learn all about apis by finding a quote API and then just simply fetching a quote from it pretty simple I'll rate this project 
[09:49](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=589) a 1 out of 10 for difficulty a 2 out of 10 for resume worthy I mean it shows you know what an API is and then a learning value of 3 out of 10 because apis are pretty important and and a 3 out of 10 
[10:00](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=600) for coolness because some quotes are pretty inspiring project number 12 an algorithm visualizer this is an advanced project and it's also a two for one you get to learn data structures and 
[10:09](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=609) algorithms which are important for interviews and you get to make a project for your resume honestly if you make this project you'll know data structures and algorithms better than if you just 
[10:17](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=617) Spam The 100 Le code problems I'll give this project a 7 out of 10 for difficulty you will need to know data structures and algorithms an 8 out of 10 for resume worthy it's a project that's 
[10:26](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=626) all about technical skills so yeah I think it'll look look good a 10 out of 10 for learning value data structures algorithms and practical programming skills it's perfect and then a 2 out of 
[10:35](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=635) 10 for coolness only programmers will understand how cool it is Project number 13 a travel booking system this is an intermediate project where you'll make a program where users can search for 
[10:45](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=645) flights book hotels plan trips and this project is not that bad if you use an API to get the information all you would have to do now is add functionality like searching booking and planning using the 
[10:55](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=655) API so You' basically just do a lot of crud methods I'll rate this a 4 out of 10 for difficulty a 7 out of 10 for resume worthy it's honestly a pretty good project and I don't think it's that 
[11:05](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=665) common I could be wrong on that but all these ratings are terrible so a 7 out of 10 for coolness only if it helps you plan your next vacation and then a 6 out of 10 for learning values you'll get to 
[11:15](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=675) learn how to integrate apis and then crud methods project number 14 quiz program this is a beginner project where you create a quiz program where users can create multiple choice questions and 
[11:25](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=685) then answer them and then they'll get their score at the end not too bad I rate this project a 2 out of 10 for difficulty a 1 out of 10 for resume worthy two out of 10 for learning value 
[11:34](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=694) and a 1 out of 10 for coolness because it's a quiz now these ratings are absolutely useless project number 15 build your own bit torrent this is a 10x developer project you know codec 
[11:44](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=704) Crafters offers this project too and if you click the link in the description bit torrent is a communication protocol for file sharing and it's used for Distributing large amounts of data by 
[11:53](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=713) making your own bit torrent you'll get to learn about the bit torrent protocol torrent files and more it's a pretty interesting project because you get you get to learn how we can download things 
[12:00](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=720) like videos games really just any large file and if you've been on the internet long enough you've probably already used bitor before for um reasons I'll rate this project um an 8 out of 10 for 
[12:11](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=731) difficulty um a 7 out of 10 for resume worthy a 10 out of 10 for learning value I guess a 5 out of 10 for coolness for uh reasons project number 16 in HTTP server this is an intermediate project 
[12:23](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=743) that will really teach you a lot about how the web works you'll learn a lot about TCP connections HTTP headers HTTP verbs handling multiple connections and more I'll rate this project a 5 out of 
[12:33](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=753) 10 for difficulty a 4 out of 10 for resume worthy a 7 out of 10 for learning value you'll get to learn a lot about how the internet works and then an 8 out of 10 for coolness because telling 
[12:42](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=762) people you built a web server makes you sound like a hacker project number 17 a realtime editor this is a pretty Advanced project where you're going to build your own version of Google docs or 
[12:51](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=771) notion where you're going to have features like real-time collaboration sharing user permissions version history for the documents and the list goes on I'll rate this project an 8 out of 10 
[13:01](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=781) for difficulty a 9 out of 10 for resume worthy real time features are pretty impressive a 10 out of 10 for coolness especially if you can handle multiple users without any problems and then a 10 
[13:11](https://youtu.be/jTJvyKZDFsY?si=BdV7igKehXgCC77I&t=791) out of 10 for learning value you'll get to learn a lot about web development and Real Time stuff project number 18 a chat bot this is a beginner to intermediate project where you can make a bot on

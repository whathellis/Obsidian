Description:: I'm not too fond of the first Blender Donut I made, so I decided to try to make it again, but with animation and stuff this time. 
It's the first time I'm adding sounds, so they are slightly off.

At first, I wanted to add just some basic sounds, but when I was editing, I accidentally dropped the wrong one into my sequence, and it sounded so hilarious that I decided to keep it. And now it's spooky donuts.

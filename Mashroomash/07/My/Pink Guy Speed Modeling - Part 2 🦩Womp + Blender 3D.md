# Pink Guy Speed Modeling - Part 2 🦩Womp + Blender 3D
<iframe title="Pink Guy Speed Modeling - Part 2 🦩Womp + Blender 3D" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6bVE5hk1xtI?feature=oembed" height="113" width="200" style="aspect-ratio: 1.76991 / 1; width: 100%; height: 100%;" allowfullscreen="" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
Description:: There are two parts of this video:
The 1st part: modeling in Womp 3D - the model could be considered finished as it is. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8vReljCfiI
The 2nd part: finishing it in Blender 3D - I changed and added some parts to make it look like a complete scene.

Some parts are very speeded up because I decided not to put them on the final model, and some are because they are not so important (as choosing the colors).

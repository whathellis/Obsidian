(Description:: This video is a timelapse of an isometric floating island I modeled in Blender. I tried to make it cube-shaped and look like from a video game. At first, I planned to render it in Eevee (so the video contains only this part) but then I liked the Cycles render more so changed some texture settings and the lighting. )
I lost some of the texturing process recordings so it looks slightly different from the render I got. Sorry. And some parts are very speeded up because I decided not to put them on the final model, and some are because they are not so important (as choosing the colors).

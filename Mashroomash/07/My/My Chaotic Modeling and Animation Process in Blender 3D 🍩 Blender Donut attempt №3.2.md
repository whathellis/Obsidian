Description:: This video is a timelapse of the modeling and animation process of the Spooky Donuts - https://youtu.be/5VgFZ6fOwIA I made in Blender 3D. I also used Photoshop for the box and Premier Pro for the sounds (it's the first time I've tried to add them, so it may be not so great. And this is the reason why this part is not in the video, and not that I just forgot to record it haha), but it's not so important. 
The animation part is pretty speeded up because it's just me going back and forth, adjusting keyframes and curves. I didn't plan it so the process may be kinda chaotic.
Also, there is a turnaround of the donut (attempt ‚Ññ2.2?) I made in Womp at the end of the video.

What the hell is this talking head with a robo-AI voice - https://youtu.be/8ARtcZ-RcEs
Some parts are very speeded up because I decided not to put them on the final model, and some are because they are not so important (as choosing the colors).

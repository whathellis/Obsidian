(Description:: This video is a 3D modeling timelapse of the simple stylizied illustration I called 'Drawing process' or 'Silly doodles' (because I didn’t find a better name). There is some texture painting parts, even so I could just put any of pinterest arts in image textures for those.)
My favorite part of this model is coffee texture. And it's not because I love coffee. I really think that it turned out pretty good. 

Some parts are very speeded up because they are not so important (as choosing the colors or tweaking the camera).

(Description:: A little gecko animation. )
It's the first time I tried to rig a character, also I wanted to play with camera a little. 
There 3 variations of the animation:
00:00 Main
00:07 Still grass
00:15 Workbench
I wanted to post it like a video and not a short, so it repeats several times from this point - 00:24 bc I don't know how to do it the other way.

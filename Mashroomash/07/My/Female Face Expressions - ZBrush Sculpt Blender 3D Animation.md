Description:: A little animation for the sculpt from the 3rd day of learning ZBrush.

I've sculpted all the expressions in ZBrush, imported them into Blender as separated meshes and created a shape key from each one. 
Also, even though I had displacement maps for both face and hair, I didn't use them for this animation because my potato-PC couldn't handle rendering more than one frame with 3 subdivision levels for both meshes.
The skin and hair textures were made in Substance Painter.

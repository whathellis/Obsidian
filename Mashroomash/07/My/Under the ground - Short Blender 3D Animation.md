(Description:: It's a short animation of the ground layers (kinda diagram) I made in Blender.)
For the skull and flowers, I used shape keys. Particle system animation for little stones. And some color and light changes. 
The skull part is my favorite. 
There are 4 variations of the final render, the first 2 are main and the second 2 are just for fun:
00:00 Isometric
00:22 Perspective
00:44 Workbench
01:05 Stopmotion?

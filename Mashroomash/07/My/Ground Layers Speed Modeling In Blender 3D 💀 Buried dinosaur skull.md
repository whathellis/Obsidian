(Description:: This video is a 3D modeling (does not include the animation part) timelapse of the isometric ground layers diagram I made in Blender for this animation -  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mIN83cSa-NM)
Some parts are very speeded up because I decided not to put them on the final model, and some are because they are not so important (as choosing the colors).

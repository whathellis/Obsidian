(Description:: This is the first proper animation I made in Blender 3D. )
There is a random and gradient color palette generator.
I wanted to post it like a video and not a short, so it repeats several times from this point - 00:28

I think, that after this project color animation became my favourite, so now I often (maybe too often) use it in my works.

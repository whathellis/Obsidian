It's kinda fun that I chose this song and only then realized that the author's name fits even better than the lyrics.

Recently I've tried Womp for the firs time, it's so fun! Haven't finished this model yet, but I transferred it to Blender just to see how it will look there and somehow it ended up in this awfully rough animation.
It's nice to try something more relaxed like Womp for a change.

(Description:: This video is a Blender 3D modeling timelapse. I tried to turn a 2D character from Asinastra's (https://www.instagram.com/miumauebin) DTIYS challenge into a 3D model. She is one of my favorite digital artists, so I was really happy to have this opportunity. And it was a good chance to practice character modeling without a need to create your original one.)
Also it's kinda fun to do those "do this in your style" challenges when I don't really have a style.

There was one part of the video where I model her boots, I made them the day before, as for my view they were the most complex part, especially those ribbons, so I can just transfer that model into the main file. And I've lost that part. I'm sorry. I didn't want to model them all over again so I've putted a screenshot I made in the process there.
Also I'm sorry for the first hand. Nobody should've seen that. But I am lazy and as far as it looks OK in the render I'm fine with it.
Some parts are very speeded up because I decided not to put them on the final model, and some are because they are not so important (as choosing the colors).

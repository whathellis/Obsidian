# Chicago International Children's Film Festival

Description:: Update from FACETS Board and Executive Leadership:

This update is to let you know that FACETS Board and Executive leadership have made the decision to pause its globally acclaimed Chicago International Childrenâ€™s Film Festival (CICFF) for the 2024 year.

FACETS will shift resources to expand yearlong family and student programming in 2024. Additionally, the organization will conduct a Strategic Evaluation resulting in a new vision for the festival and all youth programs, to be rolled out in 2025.

After celebrating the 40th anniversary of CICFF in 2023, FACETS can now focus on reimagining all of our youth programs to adequately respond to the 21st century media and education landscape. FACETS was among the very first in the world to provide a venue for young people in cinema. 40 years gives FACETS the unique perspective to evaluate the landscape of cinema, and we are determined to break new ground for coming generations.

FACETS has a great deal of robust programming planned for 2024! In addition to Youth Programs, we will continue to lead operations for the Chicago Alliance of Film Festivals, rent our prestigious 50,000 film library to members, offer our historic venue for private rentals and will roll out several new Cinema Series soon, all supporting our new mission, inspiring vital conversations through cinema experiences.

FACETS is grateful for our past collaborations and expects to grow our relationships with you as film enthusiasts and supporters of youth engagement in the film arts. We are excited about FACETS' steps forward in the coming year as we prepare to celebrate 50 years.

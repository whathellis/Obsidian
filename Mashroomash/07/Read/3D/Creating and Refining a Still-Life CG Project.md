Sophia Beglari aspires to become an environment artist at a studio where she can focus on creating beautiful, intentional, and narrative-driven work. Her fascination with video games, particularly their immersive 3D environments, sparked an interest that she never imagined could translate into a career in game development. However, upon applying to [DigiPen Institute of Technology](https://www.therookies.co/schools/digipen-institute-of-technology?ref=discover-the-rookies) and receiving acceptance with scholarships, Sophia realized that her dream of becoming an environment artist could indeed become a reality.

In this article Sophia shares her journey learning new techniques and software, to create a still-life CG Project.

Last winter, I watched Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese's show on Netflix, _Dark_. The show impacted me deeply. I resonated closely with the perseverance of all the characters and their reflection of the human experience. This piece is a tribute to the two main characters, Martha and Jonas, who, despite their fate, live on in my memory. For those of you who have watched the series, you know what I mean.

I spent a lot of time thinking about this television masterpiece. So, when I was prompted to create a still-life project for my first environment art CG course, this show popped into my mind. I live in Washington, in the greater Seattle area, and _Dark_ takes place in a small town in Germany. Despite the distance between these places, many of the show's scenes reflected the moody, dark winter months I experience living in Washington. There is something comforting about it, while also quite mysterious. My goal for this project was to capture that very mood while creating a tribute to the show that helped me accept and feel more comfortable with some of the darker parts of life. Hence, the name of the show (I imagine!).

## Setting the Tone

I began my process with a mood board, which is how I, and I'm sure every digital artist, always start. Looking at references and inspiration is important because it sets your compass in the right direction.



Images gathered on Pinterest to establish mood.

I often get caught up in creating things based on my assumptions. But after truly observing an object, I realise my mind is filled with generalisations. The diversity of things to observe in the world leads us to the necessity of anchoring our minds through reference. So I always make sure to carefully compile and observe a collection of references before I begin any project. I feature the main objects on a mood board for an at-a-glance view of the project and keep organised folders for deep dives into individual components of the piece.



The Mood Board

Each element in the piece was chosen with care based on the narrative of the show and my personal learning objectives. I wanted to create a complicated, story-driven piece that tested my modeling, assembly, and staging skills. This piece is about existence and the persistent nature of life. Tanhaus’s Clockwork Device (which, in non-_Dark_ fan terms, is just a time machine) is the center of _Dark_’s universe. Its continued existence lends itself to the existence of characters who disappear in the series, namely the main two characters featured in the polaroid on the lid of the time machine. This device is also technically very challenging to model, so it provided an excellent learning opportunity. In alignment with questions of existence, daffodils are symbols of rebirth. Showing the daffodils beginning to wilt yet still upright and recognizable was intended to highlight the uncertainty regarding the characters' ability to be reborn. I also wanted to try modeling flowers for the first time. The paper underneath the daffodil glass is the drawing of the years that are connected to the time machine, and the paper underneath the machine depicts the myth of Ariadne and the Labyrinth, which is a recurring symbol of the complex, maze-like nature of the show’s universe.



Quick Concepts

In the beginning, working on this project was harder than I expected. At the time, I was tackling the role of art director for a visually ambitious game team project, taking a full course load, working two part-time jobs, and being a TA. I was overwhelmed by all that I had to do. One of my mentors enlightened me to a tendency to take on too much being reflected in my artwork. Because this project and my game team were important to me, I cleared much of my schedule to give myself the space I needed to do my work well. Overall, my desire to be an intentional person who produces quality work grew stronger and more solid through this experience. It was time to buckle up and focus!

## Building the Scene

The emotional challenges of creating anything are often also met with tough technical challenges. Building the time machine required careful planning. It was such a complex piece, so I needed to make sure I wouldn’t run into problems like bad geometry and tricky UV unwrapping after assembling the entire thing.

To make things easier for myself, I grabbed an 11x17 sheet of paper and carefully examined my references. I drew each shape that I saw and counted how many of each there were. After all, everything is just a series of combined shapes. Breaking down the shapes the time machine was composed of and keeping a clear game plan for building it was pivotal. I also knew that UV unwrapping as I went would be crucial since many pieces in the time machine were tiny duplicates. I would build one piece, UV unwrap it, and then duplicate it as many times as I needed according to my notes. Eventually, I had a series of pieces lined up in an orderly fashion that I could assemble—almost like building Ikea furniture!

The daffodils were very enjoyable to work on but presented their own challenges. It was my first time modeling something so organic. As a part-time floral designer, accurately modeling the daffodils was crucial to me. I crafted them in a way reminiscent of a reverse dissection. If they had been in season, I would have dissected one myself. Instead, I found images of a dissected daffodil and created planes that matched the shapes of the flower petals from the dissection. Properly texturing the flowers was essential for achieving a realistic look. I aimed for them to appear on the brink of decay but not quite there yet. Achieving this proved challenging, and I don’t believe I captured this feeling until my second attempt at rendering the scene.

## Refining the Idea

I know many artists can relate to this experience: when I turned in the piece at the end of the semester, I was happy to have made it to the finish line, but I was not yet satisfied with the way it turned out. I took a break from it but felt a desire to return to it eventually. I needed some time away from the project to improve my skills as a 3D artist. The following semester, I took a course focusing on lighting in Unreal Engine 5, where I learned important concepts of lighting design and gained proficiency in navigating Unreal Engine. Working with artists on my game team also helped me upgrade my skills. When I decided it was time to return to my _Dark_ tribute, I had overcome some of the technical and learning barriers I faced in my first attempt. I came back to it better equipped to express my initial vision for the project.



Final Assignment Render in Marmoset

Due to my growing skills in Unreal Engine 5, the first thing I did was move my scene from [Marmoset](https://marmoset.co/toolbag/?ref=discover-the-rookies) to Unreal. Then, I spoke to one of my mentors at school, whose feedback on previous projects had always been highly specific. His careful eye helped me see where I could improve my work in areas I previously felt blind to. With his feedback, I fixed some of my textures, rearranged the composition, and removed the candles.



Scene in Lighting Only Mode

Another element that improved significantly after I revisited the project was the lighting and rendering. With the help of my lighting professor, I learned how to render with Path Tracer in Unreal. For my project, I aimed for high-resolution still images as my final deliverable, and Path Tracer rendering provided the best output. After ensuring all my metal textures had proper albedo values, rendering with the Path Tracer truly brought to life the challenging modeling and texturing work I had done in the previous semester. I also collaborated with her on developing a lighting scenario that better communicated the tone I desired. I aimed to convey an overcast atmosphere, so I softened my shadows significantly and adjusted the overall color of the light. With the candles removed, I experimented with creating warm light sources. Introducing a warm light from a ceiling lamp added a magical touch to the metal colors of the time machine. It’s remarkable how adjusting the balance of hue and saturation in different colored lights can drastically alter a scene. I find that even subtle tints can create an atmospheric feeling that enhances the appeal of any scene.

## Reflection

This project has been pivotal to my growth as an artist. I faced challenges in many ways, and the project helped me connect more deeply with mentors at my school who have supported me. Much of my growth this year relied on mentors who were open to guiding me and encouraging my ambitious nature. I am grateful to Christopher Poplin, Danny Samuels, Alain Schneuwly, and Morgan Rowe for their guidance while I worked on this piece.

The challenge in any art form lies in having the skill and expertise to create based on the beauty we see and feel. Working on this project showed me how rewarding it can be when we push past our learning barriers and strive to achieve our vision. The only thing holding us back from fully expressing ourselves is our lack of skill and knowledge. The exciting part about lacking skill or knowledge is that we can always continue learning and building on our abilities throughout our lives, enhancing our capacity to communicate, share, and express ourselves as artists.

I want to extend my gratitude to The Rookies for providing me with the opportunity to share my process and experience in creating this piece. It's fantastic to have a platform where budding artists can showcase their work. And thank you, reader, for joining me on this very personal creative journey.

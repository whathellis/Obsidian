# Graht Amber Weapon Set: Creating Concepts for Beyond Skyrim

This article details Jonathan Alderman's creative process for his initial contributions to the project, Beyond Skyrim: Valenwood.

---

Jonathan Alderman (aka. RRRIOM) is a recently graduated student of [Norwich University of the Arts](https://www.therookies.co/schools/norwich-university-of-the-arts?ref=discover-the-rookies), specialising in creating weapon and prop concepts. Earlier in the year, he was approached by the team working on the modding project Beyond Skyrim: Valenwood, to contribute as a 2D concept artist. This brief article details his creative process and thinking regarding his first pieces of work made for the project.

## Beyond Skyrim: Valenwood

Beyond Skyrim is a collaboration between multiple volunteer modding teams, with each focusing on bringing a separate province of Tamriel (Cyrodiil, Morrowind etc) to TES V: Skyrim. The team I am part of, Beyond Skyrim: Valenwood, is the team responsible for creating and implementing the densely forested southwestern province of Valenwood, which in lore is the home of the Bosmer/Wood Elves. Due to comparative lack of visual references when compared to some of the other provinces the Valenwood team has had to approach each aspect of the project as completely new, often having to create props, assets, environments and NPCs from scratch.

As a 2D concept artist on the team my role is to work with the 2D lead to create a concept sheet that the projects 3D artists can use to model and texture the final asset. As I specialise in creating weapons and props, for my first task I naturally gravitated to the unclaimed weapon sets, of which there were two: Graht Amber (roughly the equivalent to Skyrim’s Daedric weapon set) and Wood Orc (equivalent to Orc weapons in Skyrim.) Thanks to a prior concept artist the one-handed weapons for the Graht Amber set were already complete and so I ultimately chose to focus on finishing the collection.

Pre-existing Graht Amber weapon concepts by artist Cbkinter

### Cbkinter and Key Features

As stated previously thanks to the stellar work by concept artist cbkinter four weapons of the Graht Amber set (sword, mace, dagger and axe) were already completed, which gave me a good idea as to what the main materials and key features should be for the rest of the collection.

Firstly, despite the complexity of the design there are only four materials that go into each concept. The main weapon is a combination of amber and wood, with a brown lizard/crocodile skin for the grips and thin ropes to hold everything together.



Secondly, each of the weapons displayed a sense of ‘flow’, with the grain of the wood, direction of the engravings and the shape of the amber each naturally curving round.

Lastly, each of the bladed weapons featured a large edge at the point of the weapon that gradually tapers off near the hilt, with the engravings only located on the spine. This lack of decoration on the striking face/edge of each weapon indicates that whilst the weapons are very ornate, they are still equally capable and are deadly weapons first and foremost.

## Material Study and Moodboard

Having identified the key features of the existing weapons I then moved onto gathering relevant reference images and materials together in one place. This conglomeration of colours and textures allowed me to keep track of how each material should look when I was progressing through each step of the iterative concepting process. In addition to this the collecting of reference material in this manner also assists in the 3D modelling and texturing stages, as the 3D artist can immediately understand what texture each part of your render is. The main aspects of the pre-existing designs I explored during this stage were the engravings on the blade/head and the amber material itself.



(Images provided are purely for reference)

In the Elder Scrolls lore Graht Amber (the materials the weapons are made from) is created and collected from Graht-oaks, which are massive trees revered by the Bosmer/Wood Elves. Due to this significance the amber is highly valued as a rare and precious material and as such is only used to create the weapons and armour for the very highest members of Bosmer society.

## Weapon Concepts: The Battleaxe

Having completed my material and key feature research to a sufficient degree I then finally moved onto the actual concepting of a weapon (for the purpose of creating a succinct process breakdown in this article I am solely focusing on the creation of the battleaxe.)

Being the first weapon of the set that I designed, the Graht Amber Battleaxe was where I initially experimented with the three previously identified key shapes and motifs to figure out what aspects of cbkinter’s designs would and wouldn’t work well when scaled up for two handed weapons. With a lot of the initial silhouettes, I attempted to keep the basic shape and curve of his one-handed axe design scaled up for two handed use, which entailed fitting a longer curving handle and adding another curve or spike onto the amber. Whilst the designs that came of this were serviceable, I knew that I could get much better concepts if I just accentuated the previously mentioned key features further. To put this into practice for the rest of the remaining silhouettes I started relying on much smoother and shallower curves and edges in an effort to better display ‘flow’ within the weapon as well as focusing more on creating unusual shapes to better highlight the weapons ornate, almost ceremonial nature.

After selecting my favourite three thumbnails (first, seventh and eighteenth from left to right, top to bottom) I went about creating two different refined concepts for each design. Since each of these new concepts were fundamentally the same shape as their twin, the main changes that I made to differentiate a concept from its neighbour was the style and placement of the blade edge, the design of the engravings and the direction and placement of the wood and grips. The main issue I had during this step was attempting to make the engravings look similar to those of cbkinter’s work without directly copying them - along with incorporating the gradually growing teardrop spirals and fern like notches I identified during the key features planning stage I also decided to incorporate large circles into the engravings. In my mind these circular engravings helped balance the overall composition of the axe head as well as visually link the weapon to real world tribes and cultures who use a large number of circles in their artwork (an example being Aztec carvings, which contain an abundance of circles in reference to multiple facets of the world and the sun.)

After getting approval from my 2D lead, I then moved to fully render the chosen final design (third from the left). Since this weapon is part of a pre-existing set and will be delivered with material references, I didn’t need to fully detail everything in my final render, and so in order to speed up the development process I only added enough detail to indicate to the 3D artist what parts of the weapon line up with each provided reference. In addition, I also provided a basic front view of the weapon to give an indication as to the proportions of each part shown in the flat side view.


Final Concept

### Rest of the Weapon Set

In total I created six designs for the Graht Amber weapon set using the previously described concepting workflow (arrow, quiver, bow, battleaxe, warhammer & greatsword.) Despite their inherent differences in shape and purpose I used the exact same three predefined key design features to bring each concept as close to the original designs created by _cbkinter._

## Final Models and Finished Assets

Having fully completed the Graht Amber weapon set concepts the next stage of the production process was transferred to the teams 3D artists, where the weapons would be blocked-out, sculpted, retopologised, baked and textured before being handed over to the teams implementor for addition into the game.

Currently half of the weapon set (Greatsword, Battleaxe and Warhammer) are fully modeled, textured and in-game, with the rest soon to follow in the coming weeks. The three currently completed weapon assets were done by 3D artist [Mikołaj 'Nillusion' Michalak](https://n1llusion.artstation.com/?ref=discover-the-rookies).

Weapons In-game (due to WIP the environmental lighting isn't fully completed, leading to some textures to behave strangely.)

To close off this article I'd like to say a massive thanks to everyone on the Beyond Skyrim: Valenwood team who has guided, commented, modelled or generally helped me during my time on the team so far; being able to work on such a massive project with so many talented people straight out of Uni is a huge honour.

Future work by me (including more for Beyond Skyrim: Valenwood) can be found via my [Rookies profile](https://www.therookies.co/u/RRRIOM?ref=discover-the-rookies) where you can visit my ArtStation profile and contact me.

# Process for Creating a Game Ready Character

Rather than a strict guide on making a game character, Chase Jordan provides a broad perspective on thought processes and habits to strengthen your character making abilities.

Chase recently landed his first job as a 3D Character Artist in the games industry. He is currently a Full-Time Associate Character Artist at id Software, working on [DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tk8lkmYGWQ&ref=discover-the-rookies) with the talented team at the studio. He attended Southern New Hampshire’s Game Art and Design program and obtained his Bachelor's degree. From there, he engaged in extensive personal studying, made connections, received constant feedback from friends, and utilised resources like YouTube. While working on the project featured in this article, he was also taking anatomy for production with CGMA to maximise his anatomy studies. Everything he learned during CGMA was directly applied to Leo (this project), which he was working on simultaneously.

Chase's focus in writing this is to provide a broad perspective on thought processes and mental habits to strengthen abilities, rather than a strict guide on making a game character, with some tips along the way. With that being said, let's take a brief look at the process used to create Leo!

## Choosing a Concept

This is something I see people struggling with a lot, and it is more important than many realise. When choosing a concept, we need to make a decision: are we building this character for our portfolio to show an employer that we can do the job, or are we simply making a character for fun? This is something [Jhill](https://youtu.be/44aPVgi6S6E?si=Q3-0d9aG30wCsAG-&%3Bt=568&ref=discover-the-rookies) discusses in a couple of his YouTube videos. We have our pillar projects and then we have the bricks. The pillars are full game-ready characters showing all of the technical breakdowns, while bricks are simply to show our skills and create beautiful art.

Each of our projects should have a few primary goals we hope to improve upon. For example, before beginning my Leo Bonhart character, I realised my anatomy needed significant improvement to reach the level of an associate artist in games (compare yourself to someone who has the job you want). Since I knew I wanted my main focus to be on anatomy, this was the primary target I looked for in my concept selection.

From there, I started looking for secondary aspects I needed to work on, such as hair cards. I looked for a concept that didn't have a very complex hairstyle since it was my first attempt. By forcing yourself to observe your own weaknesses and identify what you need to grow in, you've already made choosing a concept significantly easier for yourself. From here, you simply need to find one that meets the criteria and that you enjoy. Do this with each of your portfolio pieces, and the progress you make will be very impressive. I am personally a huge fan of Witcher-style characters, so when I came across this incredible Leo Bonhart concept by [Dmitry Skovrtsov](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/4bbAk4?ref=discover-the-rookies), I was immediately inspired. Because anatomy was my main focus, I wanted to find a concept that had some really gnarly rendering and a shredded physique to give myself no wiggle room and really be forced to learn it.

Primary concept reference

From here, a lot of people will then ask, "Well, where do you find it?" I like to make it simple for myself: I use ArtStation for 90% of my main concept gathering. The other 10% is Pinterest, though Pinterest is slowly becoming an AI zone, which is less appealing to me. When I search on ArtStation, I am gathering directly from the source, and I know it's made by a real artist. This also allows me to reach out to the artist to ask for their permission to use the concept for my character and provides a direct means to tag them for credit in the end.

## Gathering Reference

One of the most important aspects of the process, and one that many beginners often avoid entirely, is gathering references. If you are not aware of it, do yourself a favor and download PureRef, the best reference viewer out there. I organize all of my references in this software for every single project.

Typically, when I start a new project for my portfolio that I know will take several months, I spend hours or even a couple of days gathering references before actually beginning. It's a pretty simple process, though. You observe each part of your character and break it down as much as you can. It's very common to continue gathering references throughout the project; don't feel like you have to gather it all at once before beginning. As character artists for games, much of what we create is obviously fantasy or sci-fi, so it can be hard to find reference material from life. I'll usually have about 50% of my references from other artists and the other 50% from life. I just load up Google and ArtStation and get to work, breaking the character into sections and finding references for each section. You also want to establish the style you're aiming for, so it's a good idea to find references similar to that style to always go back to.

### Tips for reference gathering

- If you can find a primary person to use as your reference for the face, you're going to significantly improve the quality of your work. For example, many actors have tons of HD face references online from different angles. You can avoid the uncanny valley of strange likenesses by adjusting proportions while you're referencing. The amount of nuances a face has is much more than most realize, so being able to observe all of it is key. This will change as you get better; you will rely less on reference as you strengthen your mental library. For now, use references for both the face and the body.
- Note: I didn't know about doing this yet while working on Leo. Wish I had!
- If you're able to find a primary reference for the body, that is key. Scans are hugely important when learning, as they are the closest we can get to observing from life.
- Books are invaluable resources. One of the most valuable sets of books out there is "Anatomy for Sculptors." There are three books so far: one for the whole body, one for the face, and one for the face in motion. I personally use the PDF versions of all of them and have broken down each book into PureRef files organized by section. So, I have my project PureRef open, and next to it, I have the anatomy books to always observe.
- Google has an advanced image search filter that you can use to search for only high-quality images specified by you and key words.

## Starting the Project

### Scale

One of the first things I do when beginning a 3D project is establish scale. This is something I often hear about but didn't pay much attention to—until I had to deal with the consequences of working with incorrect scale and switching between different software. I generally recommend scaling things to their real-life dimensions. I usually set the scale in Maya and then import that object into ZBrush. Alternatively, you could use something like an Unreal Mannequin or another character model, which you can use for future projects to ensure the scale is correct.



OMG why does my character look so weird???

### Engine Setup

The earlier you can get your project into your final rendering engine, the better. ZBrush's camera and lighting aren't as reliable as those in dedicated rendering engines. It's important to set up proper lighting right away so you can decimate your model and view its forms and details with a real camera and lights. I sometimes decimate my model and export it to the engine even after just a day or two of working on it in ZBrush. This process continues throughout the entire creation of the character.

## Sculpting

### ZBrush

Sculpting, as we know, is an entire universe of difficulty on its own. It requires endless hours of practice and studying to reach the levels we aspire to, and it is definitely one of the most crucial skills for progressing as a 3D character artist. Luckily, sculpting is also incredibly fun. During my time sculpting Leo, I redid the anatomy countless times, with each iteration showing gradual improvement. If I were to sum up sculpting in just a few words, I’d say: study your fundamentals, study anatomy more than you think you need to, and learn about primary, secondary, and tertiary forms as well as details, gesture, and flow. The list goes on. Ultimately, sculpting is about practice—putting in the effort day in and day out, and studying thoughtfully. For example, I’ve compiled some studies I’ve done over the last few months and put them into a PureRef. There’s much more beyond what you see here!



I sculpted Leo entirely in ZBrush, only leaving for a base simulation in [Marvelous Designer](https://www.marvelousdesigner.com/?ref=discover-the-rookies) for the pants. While sculpting anything it is incredibly important to have supporting reference. As mentioned above, have reference for everything and use it intuitively throughout the process.



One major mental roadblock I used to constantly face was the fear of destroying my progress by trying something new or pushing it further. I'd like to quote a line from one of my favorite anatomy instructors, Christian Bull: “If you can’t do the same thing twice, then you don’t deserve to have it at all.” What he means is that if you can’t destroy or change your sculpture and then recreate it, then why bother sculpting at all? It’s a great mindset to adopt—never be afraid to push your sculpt to the next level and grow.

A tool that can help you break out of this bad habit is the layers and morph target system in ZBrush. If you want to try something new or generally keep your progress safe, use layers. Layers, combined with morph targets, are among the most powerful features ZBrush has to offer.



There is an incredible amount I would change about his face sculpt if I were to redo it now, nearly nine months later. But that’s fine—if anything, I’m glad to notice its many flaws because it means I’ve been progressing. For what it is, though, I am happy with how it came out in the final renders.

As a character artist, being able to sculpt a good face is one of the most important skills to have. When I was trying to improve my face sculpting, I would do a new study every day, spending about an hour on each speed sculpt. In addition to this, I participated in a mentorship with Lukas Kutschera, who helped me refine my facial and anatomy sculpting. We worked on a much more refined character after finishing Leo. I think it is important to do speed sculpts (repetition, a lot of it) and also to take some sculpts to a much more refined state.

Trust the process!


> [!tip] Tip
> A good note to remember is its always a good idea to get the anatomy to a fairly refined state before spending your time on the outfit. The outfit sits on the anatomy, if you want your character to feel alive that outfit needs to be sitting on something solid, whether it's skin tight or baggy.

## Cloth/Simulation

I can't say I am the biggest fan of using Marvelous Designer, though sometimes the garments can be extremely simple and get you what you need. One of my current goals is to continue studying cloth sculpting so I don't always have to rely as heavily on simulations.

It is important to remember that for game characters, MD is typically used to create a base for garments. The garment is then refined further in ZBrush, where you can add details. It is extremely common in games to leave the small stitching and fabric details for compositing inside the game engine with detail normal maps. However, some studios might use different methods or tools based on their specific pipelines and requirements. Therefore, your detailing phase in ZBrush should generally focus on the base details, but be adaptable to other techniques as needed.

## Game Optimisation

When we're building our portfolios to present to employers, we want to ensure that questions get answered at a quick glance. Most importantly, you want to show the ability to make beautiful art, but almost just as important is the game optimization of a model. Low-poly topology, clean efficient UVs that are within game standards, texture maps that show knowledge of creating materials, technical breakdowns to show thought processes and techniques, rendering within a real-time renderer, and the list goes on. Here are a few examples of how I show these breakdowns for Leo.

UV maps with Albedo applied, to show packing in a more easily readable layout.

Topology that is optimised for games. Your topology does not need to be 500 tris for a full character; there's no crazy tight budget for a portfolio. What is important is showing that you know where to optimize and what is necessary to make a hero character shine without being excessive. This applies to everything. Games are all about making the most of what you have. Looking back at it, this topology is still pretty rough in some spots and could use some spring cleaning! All of this is to show the employer our ability to perform the tasks they require in order to employ us.

## Rendering

As mentioned earlier, if you want to work in games, you should be rendering your characters in real-time engines, most commonly Marmoset Toolbag and Unreal Engine 5. Unreal Engine usually gets a few brownie points since it forces you a bit more into the nitty-gritty of creating materials from scratch and interacting with a genuine game engine. While Marmoset is fantastic, it is simply for creating pretty pictures.

When it comes to rendering characters, there are some fantastic YouTube videos out there that show how to set up shaders and lighting. A couple of my favorites are by 3D Scan Store, Jhill, and Jared Chavez. Shout out to all of them!

Proper shader setup is vital to your character feeling alive; your textures are only half the battle. Take the time to learn how to shade your models and light them properly. With lighting, it is almost always best to keep it simple: a key light, fill light, and rim light are usually all you need for a beautiful render.



Turnaround shots are a valuable asset to show off your character, turntable videos as well



Close ups to show your details can hold up even when the camera is panned in

## Final Thoughts

It's been about 8 months since I published Leo on my ArtStation. He was the project that really began to excel my work and boost my confidence in my abilities. I know very well how hard the path to landing your first job is. Pretty much all of your free time becomes dedicated to 3D if you want it bad enough, and sometimes that’s just what it takes. The most important thing is to never give up. For those who think you need to attend college or a school to make it, I can firmly say that while I appreciate the school I attended, it is absolutely not the reason I am where I am today. They simply introduced me to 3D; everything you see in my portfolio has been completely on my own. YouTube university and some good friends who are always willing to lend an eye played a big part in my journey.

If you made it to the end, I hope you may have learned a thing or two. I’m not an expert, but thank you for reading!

When it comes to crafting successful products, prioritizing the interests of your users becomes paramount. This approach not only yields superior outcomes for your users but also generates greater revenue for your business.

[UX design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ux-design) revolves around creating products that delicately balance the needs and desires of users while seamlessly aligning with your business objectives. By placing users at the forefront of your [design process](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-process), you pave the way for the development of products that are not only profitable but also genuinely valuable to your target audience.

[User experience (UX)](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-experience) encompasses the totality of user [interactions](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/interaction) with a digital product or service. This field focuses on optimizing these interactions to ensure they are straightforward, engaging, and effectively meet user needs.

Central to UX is a deep understanding of users' thoughts, emotions, and behaviors as they navigate through a product. The aim is to design intuitive and visually attractive interfaces while significantly enhancing users' overall experience.[[1|1]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-1)

## What is UX design?

[

![What is UX design?](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/ux-design-1647947702221/a-1695110375797.jpg)

](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/ux-design-1647947702221/a-1695110375797-2x.jpg)

UX design, or User Experience design, is a discipline focused on creating digital products that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use. It goes beyond crafting user-friendly interfaces to delve into understanding users' behaviors and needs. By observing what users do rather than just listening to what they say, UX designers gain valuable insights that inform the design process.

The scope of UX design is broad, encompassing website development, mobile app design, software interfaces, and e-commerce platforms. It can even extend to the design of physical products. Ultimately, UX design aims to align user needs with product/business goals, which leads to increased user engagement, customer loyalty, and overall product success.

## UX design vs. UI design

[

![UX design vs. UI design](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/ux-vs-ui-design-1647947768771/a-1695110382802.jpg)

](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/ux-vs-ui-design-1647947768771/a-1695110382802-2x.jpg)

**UX and UI design are both crucial in creating digital products, but they focus on different aspects:**

- UX design is about orchestrating a holistic experience for users. It focuses on the overall journey that users go through. Key elements include understanding user needs, creating [user flows](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-flow), and testing [usability](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/usability). The goal is to provide a seamless and efficient interaction.
- [UI](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/user-interface) design complements UX by focusing on the visual aspects. This involves crafting the screens, [buttons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/buttons), and [icons](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/icons) — essentially, all the elements users interact with visually. [UI design](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/ui-design) aims to elevate the product's aesthetic appeal and emotional impact.

In short, UX design concentrates on how users interact with the product, while UI design focuses on what users see and interact with. Both disciplines are vital, collaboratively ensuring a comprehensive and engaging user experience.

## The history of UX design

[

![The history of UX design](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/the-expression-user-experience-1647947888980/a-1695110390265.jpg)

](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/the-expression-user-experience-1647947888980/a-1695110390265-2x.jpg)

**UX design has a rich history that we can trace back through decades:**

- 1940s-1950s: The concept of "user-friendly" designs begins to take root, primarily in industrial design.
- 1980s: Apple introduces the Macintosh, the first mainstream computer with a user-friendly graphical interface. This marks a significant shift towards considering the user's experience in product design.
- 1990s: With the growth of the Internet, the need for easy-to-use interfaces becomes more critical. Websites become a standard part of business, and companies begin to realize the importance of a positive user experience.
- 2000s: The launch of smartphones brings a new challenge: creating interfaces that work on small screens. The concept of mobile UX design emerges.
- 2010s-Present: As competition in the digital space intensifies, user experience becomes a key differentiator. The focus on UX design intensifies, and it becomes a crucial field in design.

As this timeline unfolds, one thing is clear: user expectations have only risen. Today, it's not enough for a product to just work; it needs to be easy and enjoyable to use. UX design has transitioned from being a luxury to a critical component for success in today's digital world.[[2|2]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-2)

## The major design figures in UX design

[

![The major design figures in UX design](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/the-major-design-figures-in-ux-design-1692600844800/a-1715595215485.jpg)

](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/the-major-design-figures-in-ux-design-1692600844800/a-1715595215485-2x.jpg)

As UX design evolved, new figures emerged that helped build this field. Some of the major contributors to UX design include:

- **Don Norman:** He is a cognitive scientist and usability engineer who, while working at Apple in the 1990s, coined the term "User Experience." He also adopted the title "User Experience Architect" and became the first known specialist to use this term in the field of UX.
- **Jakob Nielsen:** Known as the "king of usability," Nielsen is a computer scientist who defined the principles (known as Nielsen's [heuristics](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/heuristics)) that guide how we create user-friendly interfaces.
- **Alan Cooper:** Referred to as the "Father of Visual Basic," Cooper has made significant contributions to the UX field, including introducing the concept of [personas](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/personas).

## Information architecture

[

![Information architecture](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/information-architecture-1647949112463/a-1695110414996.jpg)

](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/information-architecture-1647949112463/a-1695110414996-2x.jpg)

[Information architecture (IA)](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/information-architecture) is a discipline dedicated to organizing information to facilitate easy discovery, comprehension, and utilization for task completion. It encompasses 4 essential systems: organization, labeling, [search](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/search), and [navigation](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/navigation).

Organization systems focus on categorizing and structuring information, labeling systems involve representing information through text or visual [labels](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/labels), search systems determine how users locate information, and navigation systems dictate how users traverse through the system.

Establishing a robust foundation in IA is crucial for developing a valuable and enjoyable product. UX designers play a pivotal role in achieving this by effectively organizing [content](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/content) while balancing the business requirements and needs of the target audience.

## Design thinking process

[

![Design thinking process](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/the-design-thinking-process-1647949203956/a-1695110424478.jpg)

](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/the-design-thinking-process-1647949203956/a-1695110424478-2x.jpg)

[Design thinking](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/design-thinking), a problem-solving approach centered on comprehending user needs and crafting solutions from their perspective, follows a 5-stage process. The stages are as follows:

1. **Empathize:** Conduct audience [research](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/research-knowledge) to grasp their needs, frustrations, and expectations.
2. **Define:** Clearly articulate the user-centric problem that your team will address.
3. **Ideate:** Generate a range of ideas, including unconventional ones, as potential solutions.
4. **Prototype:** Develop visual [prototypes](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/prototyping) for the most promising ideas to undergo testing.
5. **Test:** Validate assumptions, utilizing user feedback to refine solutions before committing to development.

The design thinking process is not strictly linear and often involves revisiting prior stages for refinement. This iterative approach ensures the most effective and user-centric solution.

**Pro Tip!** Incorporate design thinking right from the beginning of the project to avoid big changes in case your initial assumptions don't work out.

](https://img.uxcel.com/practices/the-300-million-button-1647948988379/a-1695110438952-2x.jpg)

A compelling example of the business impact of good UX is the story of a $300 million revenue boost from a simple button change. An e-commerce site faced high cart abandonment due to a mandatory registration form at [checkout](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/checkout).

Usability studies revealed that first-time users disliked this forced registration and often left the site. Returning customers also faced issues. 75% who tried [password](https://app.uxcel.com/glossary/password) resets failed to complete purchases. By making registration optional and adding a guest checkout feature, the site saw a $300 million rise in annual revenue and a 45% increase in purchase completions. This case underscores the impact of thoughtful and user-friendly design decisions.[[3|3]](https://app.uxcel.com/#anchor-3)

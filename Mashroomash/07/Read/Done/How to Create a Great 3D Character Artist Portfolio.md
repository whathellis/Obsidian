Building a portfolio can seem like a long and complicated task at first glance. Here, I will share my process and what to focus on: the content, the presentation, and the goals you set for yourself. Let's see how to be as efficient as possible in creating a satisfying portfolio.

## Quality Over quantity

Your portfolio should showcase your skills and attract potential employers. It must be clear and concise, as it serves as your introduction to a studio. A good portfolio should reflect your current skill level, so it's better to present a few great, original projects than many unfinished ones. Recruiters spend very little time on your profile, so be clear and concise about your skills.

Don’t hesitate to remove outdated projects. Don’t let your attachment to your first creations overshadow your objectivity. To do this, ask your peers for their opinions, including friends in the field, teachers, and professionals. It's best to avoid family members' opinions because they may be biased. If one of your creations is often criticised, it may not be up to standard. However, remember that art is subjective. A piece may be polarizing; some may love it, while others may hate it. In this case, you have to decide if it is relevant to your aspirations or not.

## Presentation

Start your portfolio with the projects you are most proud of, then alternate between high-quality and slightly lower-quality projects. End with your second-best project to hold the recruiter's attention and leave a good impression. The portfolio needs to be concise to maintain the reader's attention, providing a short and intense experience.



I aim to maintain a relatively generalist character portfolio, ensuring each presented project is as complete as possible. I handle projects from start to finish, showcasing all stages from modeling to rendering. This includes surfacing, grooming, and lighting.

It's important to show the process that led to the final image. In the end, I have a textured, groomed, well-lit render with some close-ups. I also include at least one wireframe render to show the topology, and sometimes sketches. Additionally, it is interesting to show the project's evolution by sharing some WIPs (work-in-progress shots).



I often receive the advice to always share the software logos or names to show how a project was completed. I haven't done this yet, but it's valuable advice, and I plan to apply it soon!

When using concept art or fan art as your source, always show the original work. This allows for a comparison between your work and the original, with credit given to the original artist. It's always interesting to see your interpretation of 2D references and how you solved various design challenges.



A posed character is always more appealing. However, posing unrigged characters can be tedious. Don't hesitate to use an auto-rigging tool, such as Mixamo or another software, to create a base pose. You can then sculpt some parts to achieve a credible and realistic pose.



## Finding your style

A portfolio also serves to showcase your unique style and interests. It not only displays your skills but also highlights what you enjoy working on. If your dream is to work on the next DreamWorks project, create characters in that style! Photorealistic characters, even if perfect, won't be useful in this context. A portfolio that does not represent you may lead to a job that does not suit you, which would be a shame.

Here is the cover image I created for my portfolio. It quickly conveys the type of work I do.

> If you enjoy working on a variety of projects, consider making two portfolios. You can send one or the other depending on the studio to which you apply.

## What projects to include?

There are several types of projects worth showcasing:

- If you've worked on large group projects, including videos of your characters in motion will be helpful. These videos demonstrate that your work is usable in a production setting and show your character in action, which is always more engaging.
- In group project presentations, clearly state your contributions, such as character modeling and surfacing, to avoid any confusion.



Personal projects demonstrate your commitment to your studies and hobbies. They also enhance your portfolio.



> Even if they are not as good as your more complex projects, it's still cool to see some quicker works!

Finally, small props or environments can broaden your skill set. While they are not required and may not be recommended depending on the studios you aim for, they can be useful. If you want to join a large studio with many people, it is better to specialise.


_You can show some characters in an environment too!_

## To specialise or not?

Indeed, it can be beneficial to focus on a more specific area than just "character." You could concentrate on sculpting, texturing, or grooming. Large studios often prefer specialists in these fields, while smaller studios may offer more flexible roles and may ask you to switch positions if needed.

To market yourself as a specialist, you need to be better than a generalist in that field. Therefore, it is safer for a graduate to demonstrate a broad range of skills.

For a more versatile profile, aim for diversity in your designs and character styles. Include a mix of children, men, women, and animals. Use varied clothing, hairstyles, and appearances to showcase your comfort with diverse characters.



That’s all my advice for creating a solid demo reel that aligns with your desires. I hope you find this article helpful! Please feel free to reach out via my Rookies profile [here](https://www.therookies.co/u/ElouenPoncet?ref=discover-the-rookies).

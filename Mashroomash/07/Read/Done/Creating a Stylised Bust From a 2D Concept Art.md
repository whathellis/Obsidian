# Creating a Stylised Bust From a 2D Concept Art

Discover Raphael Mistler's process for improving anatomy skills and hand-painting techniques on a stylised character from a 2D concept.

#### [Raphael Mistler](https://discover.therookies.co/author/raphael-mistler/)

[Universal Arts School](https://www.therookies.co/schools/universal-arts-school?ref=discover-the-rookies) graduate Raphael Mistler created an intriguing project that caught our eye. We asked him to share his process with readers who might also want to improve their anatomy skills and enhance their hand-painting techniques on a stylised character from a 2D concept. Read on for more inspiration!

## Project Selection

I had been wanting to create a bust or portrait for a while, but I wanted to work on something truly special. Since I lean more towards stylized art rather than realistic, I chose [Daniel Orive](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/58Ea2W?ref=discover-the-rookies)’s concept art because it was unique, challenging, and undeniably beautiful. I was drawn to the blend of flesh, skin, and bones, and at the time, I was eager to improve my anatomy skills. Additionally, I wanted to enhance my hand-painting abilities, so this project was the perfect opportunity to do just that!



## References

As the main 3D character reference, I chose Vi from _Arcane_. She has a similar haircut and also features highly stylized traits. I also selected some realistic bone references for the skull and vertebrae to help blend the open flesh parts with the closed ones.

## Blocking

For the blocking of the project, I chose to model the face with symmetry without the bones first.



Then, I added the bones and deformities of the face still symmetrically. I wanted to keep my symmetry throughout the project but only for the face, so I chose to move the body according to the reference once the main element of the face was done.



For the bones, I decided to model them independently and add them into the main mesh.



After that, I added the hair and other details like the earrings. I aimed for my project to closely resemble my one and only reference, so I focused intently on achieving that and adjusted the posing of the entire model. I then added detail to the skin, hair, flesh, and bones. Additionally, I made sure not to neglect the back of the hair and the neck, as I wanted a complete character. With these elements in place, I was ready to move on to the next step.

## Re-topology and UV

I completed the retopology of the main mesh and all the bone parts. Although I initially learned retopology using TopoGun, I now prefer Maya’s Quad Draw tool. For UV mapping, I like to use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/?ref=discover-the-rookies).



## Baking

I primarily used Marmoset Toolbag for baking, as I find its baking group system more intuitive than that of Substance or Xnormal. For the project, I used three maps: one for the eyes and bone parts, another for the hair, jewelry, eyebrows, and eyelashes, and a third for the skin and flesh parts.

## Texturing

For texturing, I used Substance 3D Painter, combining both hand-painted techniques and procedural methods with generators and masks. I start by applying the base color to the different parts, then work with the AO and all the bake maps before adding the hand-painted layers.




When texturing a model in Substance, I export my texture to Marmoset early in the process to see how it looks in a render engine. I frequently switch between the two. For the earrings, I created an alpha and added some emissives as well. I also aimed to improve my hand-painting techniques by watching tutorials, such as this one by [Meesh Chen](https://www.artstation.com/learning/courses/9yq/3d-game-ready-model/chapters/XQQP/posing-and-rendering?ref=discover-the-rookies).

## Lighting and Rendering

I love this part! Tweaking everything, playing with lights is something I really enjoy even if it’s very time-consuming.



I used a bright sky, similar to the reference, for this project. Additionally, I added five more lights: two side lights (left and right), one rim light, one light to illuminate the center of the face, and one overall light to enhance everything.

For the eyes, I used a glass material to achieve the translucent effect and added some emissive light to the iris for a deeper and shinier look. I also incorporated light subsurface scattering for this type of skin.

To achieve a better overall effect, I utilized ray tracing with additional bounces and enabled local reflection and diffuse. For post-processing, I added depth of field, bloom, grain, sharpening, and a very subtle vignette. I also adjusted the color settings, curves, and exposure.

## Final render and final thoughts!

After the final rendering, I modified some colours in Photoshop for a cleaner effect, always keeping in mind the accuracy to the original artwork.

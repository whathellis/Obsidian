Final ChouChou video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYzbWvcWiwQ

See how I added a cute animated character, ChouChou, into real footage using Blender, After Effects, and Davinci Resolve. Also featured is special guest, Kyle Balda, who directed and animated the final ChouChou piece. Kyle has a long, successful career in animation at Pixar, ILM, and Illumination. He was kind enough to share some tips on character design and animation. Enjoy!

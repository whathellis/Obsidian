Hi, usually I don't add voice to my videos, but I wanted to explain a little for this one.

So, several years ago I downloaded Blender for the first time. And as I knew nothing about It I just chose the tutorial that looked good and was long enough, because I prefer longer videos. And it was the donut.Â 

As I knew nothing I just followed it exactly as it was, and I was pretty happy with the result. But then I rendered it. In cycles. And It took like an hour or so because I had a very old PC. So, after that, I never opened Blender again until the past year.

Back then I had a decent PC, so I decided to install Blender again. This time I didn't start from the donut (even so I couldn't even remember what my first one looked like) but made it anyway after some other tutorials. And I don't like how it turned out.

So now when I at least understand what the hell I am doing, I decided to make it again with animation and stuff.

Also, sorry for the voice, all the female ones sounded kinda too old, and don't really fit.

And now you can enjoy the video of me not knowing what the hell I am doing again!

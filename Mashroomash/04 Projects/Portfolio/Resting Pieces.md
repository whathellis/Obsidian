I'm Mary, and I'm learning 3D. Someday, I'll post something if I can get out of bed.🎃 
...because I am literally resting in pieces. 
But, never mind. I made this channel to share my journey learning 3D and maybe some other art and game video records. I use Blender and most of the times render in Eevee, because my potato-computer starts to die (and so does my patience) when I use Cycles.

My goal is to create that kind of art looking at what I could think the same "WOW!" as I think looking at other artists' works.

And my dream is to work in a small indie animation studio. Or learn 3D and animation in college (This part was too long to fit to the goals section)

I am studying 3D and currently working on building a portfolio to transition into a career in the arts.

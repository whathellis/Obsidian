But what if you don't care about the reel, what if you just want to practice and treat the shot as an exercise? What should you animate then? You can easily create a list of things, just keep the shot short. It's also up to you to add complexity to it. So let's see: 🕓24.08.15 17:08 📍\- 📌

So this is a tutorial I have been meaning to write for a while now and I will try my best to cover the most common problems I see people make when XGen is involved in their pipeline. It is **important to note** that the techniques I will mention in this tutorial are not the only way to tackle XGen and I'm sure there are many alternatives out there, however this tutorial will hopefully guide you through the whole process - from set up to rendering - in a way that proved itself very stable for me during my time as a student. This is gonna be a long one so i'll split it into a few parts and hopefully when I have some more free time I may record some video tutorials to help you out! Also, this tutorial is mainly focused on character grooms that use guide curves but much of the tutorial is still relevant regardless of what type of groom you wish to make. Final note I need to make clear, the grooming process is not as linear as this tutorial so don't worry if you have to go back and fourth between stages in this tutorial! Anyway, hope you like it and if you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me, i'd be more than happy to help out :) 🕓24.09.16 15:09 📍\- 📌

- [[../../07/Read/3D/LearnOpenGL - Theory|LearnOpenGL - Theory]]:  PBR, or more commonly known as physically based rendering, is a collection of render techniques that are more or less based on the same underlying theory that more closely matches that of the physical world. As physically based rendering aims to mimic light in a physically plausible way, it generally looks more realistic compared to our original lighting algorithms like Phong and Blinn-Phong. Not only does it look better, as it closely approximates actual physics, we (and especially the artists) can author surface materials based on physical parameters without having to resort to cheap hacks and tweaks to make the lighting look right. One of the bigger advantages of authoring materials based on physical parameters is that these materials will look correct regardless of lighting conditions; something that is not true in non-PBR pipelines. 🕓24.08.20 20:08 📍\- 📌

- [[../../07/Read/The Hitchhiker's Guide to Digital Colour/Question 8 What the Fuck Type of “Linear” Have We Been Assuming|Question 8 What the Fuck Type of “Linear” Have We Been Assuming]]:  I’m going to spoil our trend of not answering questions with an actual answer, that is somewhat not-too-secretly buried it the question itself. That is, this isn’t even a question, but more of a pit stop in the glossary. Specifically, the four previous questions culminate in the term we are going to Achievement Unlock: 🕓24.08.22 18:08 📍[[../Topics/The Hitchhiker's Guide to Digital Colour|The Hitchhiker's Guide to Digital Colour]] 📌
- [[../../07/Read/The Hitchhiker's Guide to Digital Colour/Question 9 Why the Fuck is Linear Light Important for a Digital Artist|Question 9 Why the Fuck is Linear Light Important for a Digital Artist]]:  [In our last question, we took a quick dive into discussing what a particular type of linear, *display linear*, is related to.](https://hg2dc.com/question-8/) What we haven’t discussed yet, is why there has been all of this talk about linear in the first place. Why do linear versus nonlinear encodings matter if you’ve been happily painting in Photoshop or Affinity’s tools and not giving a crap about this rubbish? We’ll try to skip getting into the math and use a simple visual demonstration to hammer our point home. 🕓24.08.22 18:08 📍[[../Topics/The Hitchhiker's Guide to Digital Colour|The Hitchhiker's Guide to Digital Colour]] 📌

- [[../../07/Read/USD Terms and Concepts — Universal Scene Description 24.08 documentation|USD Terms and Concepts — Universal Scene Description 24.08 documentation]]:  USD introduces quite a few terms and concepts, some of which, unavoidably, already have different meanings in other contexts, so it can be quite daunting to make sense of all of our documentation and code until you have become fully indoctrinated. This document attempts to define and explain all the major concepts and behaviors referred to in other parts of the USD documentation. 🕓24.09.23 17:09 📍\- 📌
- [[../../07/Read/USD or Alembic  Multiverse|USD or Alembic  Multiverse]]:  Multiverse version 6 introduced a new multi-threaded architecture which is natively based on USD. Multiverse reads and writes 100% native USD files, it is by consequence a USD-first software: because of the many advantages of USD **we recommend to use USD rather than ABC whenever possible**. 🕓24.09.23 17:09 📍\- 📌

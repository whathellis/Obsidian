Welcome to Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Creating 3D Stylized Environments! This series will break down my entire workflow for Creating Stylized Environment Art using Maya, Zbrush, and Substance Painter. I've broken down my entire 3d stylized environment art into a 5 part series. The goal is to be able to take any idea, concept, or even existing 3d model; Apply certain stylized art characteristics along with my step-by-step workflow to end up with a beautiful piece of environment art.

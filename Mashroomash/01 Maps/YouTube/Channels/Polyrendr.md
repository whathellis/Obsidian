- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Full 3D Modeling Workflow  Autodesk Maya + Substance 3D Painter|Full 3D Modeling Workflow  Autodesk Maya + Substance 3D Painter]]:  In this video I go through the full process creating an emergency control panel using Autodesk Maya and Adobe Substance 3D Painter. I wanted to change it up this week and make a slower-paced video where I cover my 3D modeling, UV mapping, and texturing workflow. The reference I used was based off of two images, a concept by Ali Raham, and another one by an unknown artist. 🕓1h 48m 57s 📍video/3D/hardsurface, video/3D/SubstancePainter, video/3D/Maya 📝\- 📌24.08.07 13:08

I 3D modelled it using Autodesk Maya and textured it using Adobe Substance 3D Painter. 🕓1h 34m 59s 📍video/3D/SubstancePainter, video/3D/hardsurface, video/3D/Maya 📝\- 📌24.08.22 14:08
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Command HQ  Autodesk Maya + Substance 3D Painter|Command HQ  Autodesk Maya + Substance 3D Painter]]:  In this video I create a small military Command Headquarters. I 3D modelled it using Autodesk Maya and textured it using Adobe Substance 3D Painter. It was based off of an image from Soldiers Inc. and Command and Conquer. 🕓37m 32s 📍video/3D/hardsurface, video/3D/SubstancePainter, video/3D/Maya 📝\- 📌24.08.22 14:08

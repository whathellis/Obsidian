- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/New/CREATE PROCEDURAL LOW-POLY WORLDS - 3D Laboratory Twitch Stream!|CREATE PROCEDURAL LOW-POLY WORLDS - 3D Laboratory Twitch Stream!]]:  This video is a Twitch Stream recording from the 20th of July, 2020. In this stream we made some kick-arse low poly animation using procedural techniques with vertex weights and displacement maps! 🕓1h 6m 27s 📍video/3D/tutorial, video/3D/node 📝 📌
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling For Animation 01 - TOP 5 Features of Good Animation Models!|Modeling For Animation 01 - TOP 5 Features of Good Animation Models!]]:  Part 1 of a huge series I'm setting out to make! Starting with Modeling for Animation. This video will give you my hot tips on what I think makes for a great animation model! The next video we will deep dive into the process with the ultimate goal - create an animated character from scratch! 🕓30m 38s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 10 - CONVERTING AN EXISTING CHARACTER INTO A NEW ONE!|Modeling for Animation 10 - CONVERTING AN EXISTING CHARACTER INTO A NEW ONE!]], [[../Playlist/Modeling for Animation!|Modeling for Animation!]] 📌\-
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling For Animation 02 - Planning, and Blocking the Body and Limbs|Modeling For Animation 02 - Planning, and Blocking the Body and Limbs]]:  In this video, we set out a game plan on how to approach the blocking of the body, including setting our scale, where to place our key loops of articulation, and capping it off with some quick and dirty articulation tests using Adobe Mixamo! 🕓48m 20s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling For Animation 01 - TOP 5 Features of Good Animation Models!|Modeling For Animation 01 - TOP 5 Features of Good Animation Models!]], [[../Playlist/Modeling for Animation!|Modeling for Animation!]] 📌\-
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 03 - Adding Volume to the Body!|Modeling for Animation 03 - Adding Volume to the Body!]]:  In this video we improve the elbows, knees, shoulders and butt to improve their deformation during animation! 🕓21m 12s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling For Animation 02 - Planning, and Blocking the Body and Limbs|Modeling For Animation 02 - Planning, and Blocking the Body and Limbs]], [[../Playlist/Modeling for Animation!|Modeling for Animation!]] 📌\-
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 04 - Building the Hands!|Modeling for Animation 04 - Building the Hands!]]:  In this video we construct the hands by considering the form and articulation of the fingers, thumb and palm. We give it a bit of a test whirl with the rigify metarig then, We then re-attach the hand to the body and have some fun with mixamo! 🕓33m 58s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 03 - Adding Volume to the Body!|Modeling for Animation 03 - Adding Volume to the Body!]], [[../Playlist/Modeling for Animation!|Modeling for Animation!]] 📌\-
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 05 - Sculpting the Face!|Modeling for Animation 05 - Sculpting the Face!]]:  In this video, we construct a simple blocking of the face using primitive shapes, then remesh the model in order to sculpt! I talk about the considerations to make while sculpting and also offer a  few insights about the process. 🕓32m 56s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 04 - Building the Hands!|Modeling for Animation 04 - Building the Hands!]], [[../Playlist/Modeling for Animation!|Modeling for Animation!]] 📌\-
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 06 - Retopologising the Face!|Modeling for Animation 06 - Retopologising the Face!]]:  In this video, we work through the puzzling task of retopologising the face. Starting by demistifying the edge flow, we then dive into the action by blocking out the initial flow, and gradually work through the rest of the face! 🕓52m 16s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 05 - Sculpting the Face!|Modeling for Animation 05 - Sculpting the Face!]], [[../Playlist/Modeling for Animation!|Modeling for Animation!]] 📌24.07.16 14:07
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 07 - Modeling Polygon Hair!|Modeling for Animation 07 - Modeling Polygon Hair!]]:  In this video I talk through the process of modelling polygonal hair! There's so many methods you can do with this, that it would be impossible to cover in a single video, so I share some of the common methods I perform, while speaking generally about how to approach hair modeling from a problem solving perspective! 🕓16m 17s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 06 - Retopologising the Face!|Modeling for Animation 06 - Retopologising the Face!]], [[../Playlist/Modeling for Animation!|Modeling for Animation!]] 📌\-
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 08 - Modeling The Clothes!|Modeling for Animation 08 - Modeling The Clothes!]]:  In this video we work through modeling the clothes. By using the underlying body mesh as a starting point, you'll be able to smash out fancy clothes in no time at all! 🕓23m 27s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 07 - Modeling Polygon Hair!|Modeling for Animation 07 - Modeling Polygon Hair!]], [[../Playlist/Modeling for Animation!|Modeling for Animation!]] 📌\-
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 09 - Extra Bits! (Feet, Teeth, Tummy and More!)|Modeling for Animation 09 - Extra Bits! (Feet, Teeth, Tummy and More!)]]:  In this video, we go through the process of building out the feet properly, and add a few extra bits and bobs to flesh out the character more. Things like adding some volume loops to the stomach, adding teeth and gums, and more! 🕓23m 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 08 - Modeling The Clothes!|Modeling for Animation 08 - Modeling The Clothes!]], [[../Playlist/Modeling for Animation!|Modeling for Animation!]] 📌\-
- [[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 10 - CONVERTING AN EXISTING CHARACTER INTO A NEW ONE!|Modeling for Animation 10 - CONVERTING AN EXISTING CHARACTER INTO A NEW ONE!]]:  In this final video we take the model of Sophie and morph her into a whole new character! Using the same mesh to create  new characters not only saves time, but has a whole range of other advantages too! 🕓24m 38s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../../../07/YouTube/3D/Playlist/Modeling for Animation 09 - Extra Bits!

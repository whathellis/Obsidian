- [[../../../07/YouTube/Playlist/03 Interface and Basics - Geometry Nodes For Beginners  Blender 3.0(Fields)|03 Interface and Basics - Geometry Nodes For Beginners  Blender 3.0(Fields)]]:  Welcome to another short tutorial series about hot topic of the blender community, which is also the latest and anticipated feature - Geometry Nodes. 🕓35m 18s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../Playlist/Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D|Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D]] 📌24.07.16
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Playlist/04 Applying Materials - Geometry Nodes For Beginners  Blender 3.0|04 Applying Materials - Geometry Nodes For Beginners  Blender 3.0]]:  Welcome to another short tutorial series about hot topic of the blender community, which is also the latest and anticipated feature - Geometry Nodes.  In this chapter 4, we are going to discuss... the basic process of applying material on the composition that we built with Geometry Nodes Basics in previous chapter. This is just to familiarize yourself with rendering process of objects made with GN, so that we can make renders out of whatever things we are going to make during this course. 🕓13m 23s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../Playlist/Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D|Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D]] 📌24.07.16 18:07
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Playlist/05 Understanding Basic Math  - Geometry Nodes For Beginners  Blender 3.0|05 Understanding Basic Math  - Geometry Nodes For Beginners  Blender 3.0]]:  Welcome to another short tutorial series about hot topic of the blender community, which is also the latest and anticipated feature - Geometry Nodes. In this chapter 5, we are going to discuss... the absolute basics of math nodes and few things about different input and output types. These will help you understand and build more complex relations between nodes procedurally. Also this is groundwork for further examples we are going to discuss whether its visual or motion. 🕓21m 22s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../Playlist/Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D|Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D]] 📌24.07.16 18:07
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Playlist/06 Displacing Geometry - Geometry Nodes For Beginners  Blender 3.0(Fields)|06 Displacing Geometry - Geometry Nodes For Beginners  Blender 3.0(Fields)]]:  Welcome to another short tutorial series about hot topic of the blender community, which is also the latest and anticipated feature - Geometry Nodes. In this chapter 6, we are going to discuss... a few more things about math, use the same nodes that we made animation with in last chpater, but this time use math, vectors, floats and textures to make basis displacement on a mesh. Basicaly , we will learn basics of manipulating geometry with help of nodes, and shape up some nice looking landscapes. 🕓15m 9s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../Playlist/Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D|Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D]] 📌24.07.16 18:07
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Playlist/07 Points and Instancing - Geometry Nodes( Fields) For Beginners  Blender 3.0|07 Points and Instancing - Geometry Nodes( Fields) For Beginners  Blender 3.0]]:  components of meshes in 3D are not just to build surfaces and render objects, these components can help guide other instances in the scene, scatter things around and generate points to build up much more organic, and complex distribution of objects. Today we are going to talk a few basics of object instancing on points 🕓29m 18s 📍video/3D/playlist 📝[[../Playlist/Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D|Geometry Nodes For Beginners - Blender 3D]] 📌24.07.16 18:07

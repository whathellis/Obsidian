- [[../../../07/YouTube/Animation/How I Conceptualize Animations From Scratch|How I Conceptualize Animations From Scratch]]:  Last 2020, Ben invited me to this collaboration between 60 animators. The title that I chose was Self Love. In this video, I'll break down the process, and we'll go into detail about conceptualizing, designing, animating, and compositing. This is a frame by frame animation project but this isn't a step by step tutorial. This video would dive more into the thinking part behind the animation. 🕓45m 41s 📍\- 📝 📌24.07.23 15:07

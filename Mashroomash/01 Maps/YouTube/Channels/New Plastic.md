- [[../../../07/YouTube/Study/Color Management for CGI Artists|Color Management for CGI Artists]]:  Color management is one of those intimidating aspects of digital image-making, that we all just have to be part of one way or another. I feel like most artists are walking in the dark when it comes to working with colors, so I thought I would make a digestible video that hopefully will help clear some things out. You're not going to learn all about color-management here, but hopefully it'll clear some of the confusion surrounding it. 🕓20m 17s 📍video/3D/color 📝\- 📌24.08.06 15:08
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Watched/AE/After Effects Workflow for AgX & ACES|After Effects Workflow for AgX & ACES]]:  As mentioned in the previous video, working with EXRs in a linear workflow is the only way you want to go when it comes to post-compositing. We learned how to work with AgX and ACES inside Cinema 4D & Octane, and this time we'll look into how to continue this workflow into After Effects, where you might do your post-compositing. The first part of the video will show the process in the previous AE versions, and at the end of the video we look at how to do it in the newest AE update. It's simpler than you think! 🕓19m 28s 📍video/3D/color, video/soft/AE 📝\- 📌24.08.27
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Watched/AE/Cinema 4D Tutorial - Z-Depth Pass (Octane & After Effects)|Cinema 4D Tutorial - Z-Depth Pass (Octane & After Effects)]]:  In this Cinema 4D tutorial we'll go over a few ways to use the Z-Depth pass beyond the classic Depth-of-Field blur. I've been using a lot of these techniques in different projects throughout the years and I felt like sharing them. These techniques can work with a z-depth pass from any rendering engine, and on any post-compositing software. I'll be using After Effects. 🕓9m 27s 📍video/soft/AE, video/3D/color 📝\- 📌24.08.22 14:08
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Watched/Tutorial/Cinema 4D QuickTip - UV Unwrapping the Easy Way|Cinema 4D QuickTip - UV Unwrapping the Easy Way]]:  In this C4D quick tip I'll show you how to UV unwrap this simple model in the easiest way possible. UV unwrapping is a dreaded but essential part of 3d modeling, which is why it's important to at least understand how to approach it in the most basic way. And this is what I'm showing you here! I use this method on pretty much every model that I have and it works good enough 100% of the time. 🕓5m 27s 📍video/3D/4D 📝\- 📌24.08.12
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Watched/Tutorial/Cinema 4D Tutorial - Box Modeling a Cartoon Hand|Cinema 4D Tutorial - Box Modeling a Cartoon Hand]]:  In this C4D tutorial I'll show you how I model this cute chubby hand using box-modeling technique. We'll go over how I use this technique to achieve a clean and healthy mesh while maintaining style and personality. 🕓20m 31s 📍video/3D/4D 📝\- 📌24.08.12
- [[../../../07/YouTube/Watched/Tutorial/Cinema 4D Tutorial - Rigging & Animating a Hand|Cinema 4D Tutorial - Rigging & Animating a Hand]]:  In this C4D tutorial I'll show you how I rig and animate the hand model we created in the last tutorial. We'll go over how to create a healthy skeleton, how to approach weight painting, and how to create an efficient animation system using the Pose-Morph tag. As a bonus, I'll also show you how to mirror any rig that you have while keeping all the weights. 🕓19m 16s 📍video/3D/4D 📝\- 📌24.08.12

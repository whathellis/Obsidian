- position - 
	- vector (length is always positive) 
- components - (a,b) 2,3
- sign (x) - direction
	- in one dimension you can only have directions that are either *-1* or *1*
- absolute number (x) - length / magnitude - 
- unit vector = vector that have the length of 1
- value

# 2 dimensional vector
have 2 axes, and 2 numbers to represent position
X  -  red
Y - green
Z - blue


- adding and extracting -  and ≠
- negation - 
- reciprocal - 


to represent something the same lengh we use circles but not in 1 demention

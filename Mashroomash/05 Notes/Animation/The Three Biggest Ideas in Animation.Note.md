If you're working on an animation, youÂ can ask yourself [[./Animation Basics in 14 Minutes (6 Big ideas for beginners).Note#^f81db2|How does this motion feel?]] And if the answer is *not great* we can look for the solutions:
- Start with posing 
	- Without images in place we don't have the ingredients we need
	- If you want a character to look one direction you need to make sure you have poses of them looking in that direction.
	- Focus on key poses
- Decide on the pace and rhythm (timing)
- Spacing
	- Play with exaggeration, flow and energy
	- Fix jitterness or jumpiness

#### There are two ways to animate (pretty much):
`````col
````col-md
flexGrow=1

````
````col-md

````
````col-md
flexGrow=1

1. Straight ahead - create 1 frame after the other
	- [(] Hard to change smth
	- [)] Fluid
	- [)] Spontaneous
2. Key framing (pose to pose) - create the most important frames first and fill the gaps afterwards
	- [)] Faster method for complicated motion
	- [)] Easier to adjust
	- [(] Can feel rigid
3. Combined

#### How to chose:
- Effects like water or fire - straight ahead
- Heir and clothes - straight ahead, after the character animation is done
- For most stop-motion you'll need to use straight ahead
- 3D - key frame

###### Homework:
1. Create an animation using one of these methods
2. Then try to recreate it in another

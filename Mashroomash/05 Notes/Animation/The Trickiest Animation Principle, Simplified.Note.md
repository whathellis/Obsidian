[[The Trickiest Animation Principle, Simplified|The Trickiest Animation Principle, Simplified]]
### How much space should I put between these frames?
#### The answer will depend on two things:
1. How fast you want your object to move?
	- Fast - further apart
	- Slow - closer together
2. Is it speeding up, slowing down or staying constant?
	1. Think about the applied [[The Trickiest Animation Principle, Simplified.Note#Forces|forces]]
	2. Look at the last two frames and make the next one
		- Speed up -  further apart from them
		- Slow down - closer together to them
		- Stay constant - make your spacing the exact same

>  For something to be moving at a constant speed, or seating still, all of the forces applied to it need to be perfectly balanced.

This is why we usually don't see such a movement.
And if we do, it's usually accompanied by the movement speeding up and then slowing down - [[./Animation Basics in 14 Minutes (6 Big ideas for beginners).Note#2. Acceleration and deceleration - easing|acceleration and deceleration or easing]].

Easing require some sort of force to be happening, and that force needs to bee greater than any of the other forces applied. ^0532c1

#### Forces
- *Friction* -  decelerate.
- *Gravity* - speed up with it and slows down against.
- *Contact* - the forces change most dramatically.

1. Applying force - accelerating
2. For a moment the force and friction force are equal - constant speed
3. Stop applying force - the only force applied now is friction - decelerating

#### Exaggerate the spacing
Reasons to do so:
1. Add impact and appeal to the movement
2. Help communicate with the audience

How to do it:
- Break the laws of physics as much as you like
- But in a believable direction
- Use forces to find that direction
### Homework:
1. Create 3 animations one for each speed
2. Bonus: one for each force

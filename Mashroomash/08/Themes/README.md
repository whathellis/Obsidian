# Obsidian-Notebook-Themes v2.2.3
## A Series of Notebook Theme CSS Snippets for Obsidian.
These a few CSS classes that mimic a few of my real-world notebook pages and pen colors.
Go ahead and try it out! You can change or add new color variables or entire new
classes and combinations. Inside Obsidian, apply a page class with an optional
pen color class to see the effects. Add the `recolor-images` class to recolor
the images in your notes, too! *(for images with transparency).*
Check out the full video going over the process [here](https://youtu.be/9T9VL8_i1Tg)!

### Page Background Colors
- White (`page-white`)
- Manila/Tan (`page-manila`)
- Blueprint (`page-blueprint`)

### Pen Colors
- Black (`pen-black`)
- Gray (`pen-gray`)
- Red (`pen-red`)
- Green (`pen-green`)
- Blue (`pen-blue`)
- Purple (`pen-purple`)
- White (`pen-white`)

### Other Classes
- `recolor-images`: Recolors all images on the page to match the current pen color.
- `page-grid`: Adds grid lines to the page background.
- `embed-<PAGE-COLOR>`: Adds the specified page color as a background for all embedded images on a page.

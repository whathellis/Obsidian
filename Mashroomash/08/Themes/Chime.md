Chime was designed with a special intention to not overwhelm you with options. Built on the principle of highly customizable simplicity,Â **Chime**Â provides vast personalization options without going past only what's most important.

## Features

With the Style Settings plug-in,Â **Chime**Â boasts the following features:

- 12 differentÂ **color schemes**
- Two differentÂ **layout styles.**
- Hide certain buttons and enable full-screenÂ **Focus Mode**
- Special style settings for theÂ **page-gallery plug-in**
- Options for stylingÂ **blockquotes, headings, checkboxes, links,**Â andÂ _more_.
- Four special css classes

## CSS Classes

Chime includes four css classes that may come in handy to some people.

|Image|Class|Description|
|---|---|---|
|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bluemoondragon07/chime-theme/HEAD/wiki-page.png)|`wiki-page`|Format your note like a wiki page. This class floats **images** and **info blockquotes** to the right and formats headings and text.|
|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bluemoondragon07/chime-theme/HEAD/novel.png)|`novel`|Format your note like a page in a book. This class changes the **font, indentation, and paragraph spacing.** Pressing enter **once** creates a **normal paragraph** without an indent (great if you don't like indented dialogue), while pressing enter **twice**, like you would usually create a paragraph in Obsidian, creates an **indented paragraph**. Both paragraphs are evenly spaced in preview mode.|
|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bluemoondragon07/chime-theme/HEAD/wide.png)|`wide`|Makes a note wide even when Readable Line Length is turned on.|
|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bluemoondragon07/chime-theme/HEAD/cards.png)|`cards` (by [kepano](https://github.com/kepano))|[![](https://img.buymeacoffee.com/button-api/?text=Buy%20kepano%20a%20coffee&emoji=&slug=kepano&button_colour=6a8695&font_colour=ffffff&font_family=Poppins&outline_colour=000000&coffee_colour=FFDD00)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kepano)  <br>  <br>Makes dataview tables show up as a grid of cards. Originally created by kepano for the Minimal theme.|

## ðŸ”Œ Compatible Plug-Ins

### Dataview

**Chime**Â includes styling for inline metadata and dataview tables. TheÂ `cards`Â class also utilizes this plug-in.

### Pages Gallery

Chime makes minor changes to theÂ [[Obsidian Page Gallery|Obsidian Page Gallery]]Â plug-in and gives it an appearance similar to that of the cards css class. Text will now break and continue on a new line rather than overflowing whenÂ _responsive height_Â is enabled, and the tiles will be resized according to amount of text with theÂ _loose tiles_Â setting. Images will be automatically set toÂ _cover_Â and will overrideÂ _contain_Â (this may change later, I just couldn't get the images to force certain ratios in contain mode). The font size within the tiles has been adjusted and a style setting has been added to get rid of the searchbar.

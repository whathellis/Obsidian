Just like pages, you can also add¬†**fields**¬†on list item and task level to bind it to a specific task as context. For this you need to use the¬†inline fields - [[./Adding Metadata|Adding Metadata]]:

`- [ ] Hello, this is some [metadata:: value]! - [X] I finished this on [completion:: 2021-08-15].`

Tasks and list items are the same data wise, so all your bullet points have all the information described here available, too.

## Field Shorthands

The¬†[Tasks](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction)¬†plugin introduced a different¬†[notation by using Emoji](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/Tasks+Emoji+Format)¬†to configure the different dates related to a task. In the context of Dataview, this notation is called¬†`Field Shorthands`. The current version of Dataview only support the dates shorthands as shown below. The priorities and recurrence shorthands are not supported.

Example

Example

- [ ] Due this Saturday üóìÔ∏è2021-08-29
- [x] Completed last Saturday ‚úÖ2021-08-22
- [ ] I made this on ‚ûï1990-06-14
- [ ] Task I can start this weekend üõ´2021-08-29
- [x] Task I finished ahead of schedule ‚è≥2021-08-29 ‚úÖ2021-08-22

There are two specifics to these emoji-shorthands. First, they omit the inline field syntax (no¬†`[üóìÔ∏è:: YYYY-MM-DD]`¬†needed) and secondly, they map to a¬†**textual**¬†field name data-wise:

|Field name|Short hand syntax|
|---|---|
|due|`üóìÔ∏èYYYY-MM-DD`|
|completion|`‚úÖYYYY-MM-DD`|
|created|`‚ûïYYYY-MM-DD`|
|start|`üõ´YYYY-MM-DD`|
|scheduled|`‚è≥YYYY-MM-DD`|

This means if you want to query for all tasks that are completed 2021-08-22, you'll write:

` - [x] Completed last Saturday ‚úÖ2021-08-22
- [x] Task I finished ahead of schedule ‚è≥2021-08-29 ‚úÖ2021-08-22
 `

Which will list both variants - shorthands and textual annotation:

`- [x] Completed last Saturday ‚úÖ2021-08-22 - [x] Some Done Task [completion:: 2021-08-22]`

## Implicit Fields

As with pages, Dataview adds a number of implicit fields to each task or list item:

Inheritance of Fields

Tasks inherit¬†_all fields_¬†from their parent page - so if you have a¬†`rating`¬†field in your page, you can also access it on your task in a¬†`TASK`¬†Query.

|Field name|Data Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`status`|Text|The completion status of this task, as determined by the character inside the¬†`[ ]`¬†brackets. Generally a space¬†`" "`¬†for incomplete tasks and an¬†`"x"`¬†for completed tasks, but allows for plugins which support alternative task statuses.|
|`checked`|Boolean|Whether or not this task's status is¬†**not**¬†empty, meaning it has some¬†`status`¬†character (which may or may not be¬†`"x"`) instead of a space in its¬†`[ ]`¬†brackets.|
|`completed`|Boolean|Whether or not this¬†_specific_¬†task has been completed; this does not consider the completion or non-completion of any child tasks. A task is explicitly considered "completed" if it has been marked with an¬†`"x"`. If you use a custom status, e.g.¬†`[-]`,¬†`checked`¬†will be true, whereas¬†`completed`¬†will be false.|
|`fullyCompleted`|Boolean|Whether or not this task and¬†**all**¬†of its subtasks are completed.|
|`text`|Text|The plain text of this task, including any metadata field annotations.|
|`visual`|Text|The text of this task, which is rendered by Dataview. This field can be overriden in DataviewJS to allow for different task text to be rendered than the regular task text, while still allowing the task to be checked (since Dataview validation logic normally checks the text against the text in-file).|
|`line`|Number|The line of the file this task shows up on.|
|`lineCount`|Number|The number of Markdown lines that this task takes up.|
|`path`|Text|The full path of the file this task is in. Equals to¬†`file.path`¬†for¬†[pages](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/metadata-pages/).|
|`section`|Link|Link to the section this task is contained in.|
|`tags`|List|Any tags inside the task text.|
|`outlinks`|List|Any links defined in this task.|
|`link`|Link|Link to the closest linkable block near this task; useful for making links which go to the task.|
|`children`|List|Any subtasks or sublists of this task.|
|`task`|Boolean|If true, this is a task; otherwise, it is a regular list element.|
|`annotated`|Boolean|True if the task text contains any metadata fields, false otherwise.|
|`parent`|Number|The line number of the task above this task, if present; will be null if this is a root-level task.|
|`blockId`|Text|The block ID of this task / list element, if one has been defined with the¬†`^blockId`¬†syntax; otherwise null.|

With usage of the¬†[shorthand syntax](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/metadata-tasks/#field-shorthands), following additional properties may be available:

- `completion`: The date a task was completed.
- : The date a task is due, if it has one.
- `created`: The date a task was created.
- `start`: The date a task can be started.
- `scheduled`: The date a task is scheduled to work on.

### Accessing Implicit Fields in Queries

If you're using a¬†[TASK](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/query-types/#task-queries)¬†Query, your tasks are the top level information and can be used without any prefix:

- [8] We can simplify all the little ideas about animation to the 3 most important ideas:
- [ ] I've always felt that there is something wrong with me.
- [-] I have relationship and intimacy problems.
- [-] I tend to get through things rather than experience and or enjoy them. (Vacations, Holidays, Projects, Shopping, Gatherings)
- [-] Dysfunctional people seek me out.
- [-] Being wrong and or right means too much to me.
- [ ] I can get into certain modes. (survival mode, work mode, rescue mode, emergency mode).
- [-] When things are going well, I don‚Äôt trust it.
- [-] Growing up, my parent(s) were rageful, volatile, dominating, depressed, unavailable or neurotic.
- [-] Growing up, there was manipulation and or injustice.
- [-] Growing up, I experienced corporal punishment.
- [-] I get upset when others don‚Äôt read what is going on with me.
- [ ] I can overpower or shut down during conflict.
- [ ] I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm intense (too serious), or disengaged (aloof).
- [ ] I anticipate that other people will be upset with me and or that they will let me down.
- [-] I can be greatly affected by other people‚Äôs moods.
- [-] Compliments make me uncomfortable and I minimize them.
- [ ] Rejection puts me in a very bad place.
- [-] I can often view myself based on the way people react or respond to me.
- [-] When someone is caring or nurturing I question it and feel uncomfortable.
- [-] I can often feel used or taken advantage of.
- [-] I often do not trust my own feelings or the feelings of others.
- [-] I can be reactive or deeply affected by criticism (any kind).
- [-] I feel that I‚Äôm not worthwhile unless I‚Äôm a satisfactory lover.
- [ ] Growing up, things were not talked about. (emotions, situations, elephants in the room).
- [-] I‚Äôve felt inadequate about my gender.
- [ ] I don't like being touched.
- [ ] I‚Äôve only ended relationships once things get very bad.
- [-] I‚Äôm perfectionistic and or rigid.
- [ ] Growing up I had feelings about killing one or both my parents which caused shame.
- [-] One or both my parents overly confided in me growing up about their problems.
- [ ] Angry people and people in authority freak me out.
- [ ] I tend to think about my feelings v. feeling them fully.
- [-] Speaking up about my needs/preferences or saying no, is difficult for me.

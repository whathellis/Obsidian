Description:: I didn’t got the real cake on my birthday so I modeled one to make some kind of a present.
The music is as sad as my BD was.

This video is a 3D modeling timelapse of a Birthday cake I made for myself in Blender 3D.
Some parts are very speeded up because I decided not to put them on the final model, and some are because they are not so important (as choosing the colors).
I didn't have a sketch or a clear understanding of the final model I wanted to make, so it's just a bunch of pinterest cakes combined together.

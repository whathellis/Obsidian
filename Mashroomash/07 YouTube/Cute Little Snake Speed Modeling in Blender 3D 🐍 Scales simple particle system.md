Description:: This video is a 3D modeling timelapse of the little snake with a pretty simple scales particle system (and some weight painting) from the animation - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XkLkFk6e4Tk I made some time ago. 
Some parts are very speeded up because I decided not to put them on the final model, and some are because they are not so important (like tweaking the camera).

# square

Description:: Draws a square.

A square is a four-sided shape defined by the `x`, `y`, and `s` parameters. `x` and `y` set the location of its top-left corner. `s` sets its width and height. Every angle in the square measures 90Ëš and all its sides are the same length. See [rectMode()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rectMode/) for other ways to define squares.

The version of `square()` with four parameters creates a rounded square. The fourth parameter sets the radius for all four corners.

The version of `square()` with seven parameters also creates a rounded square. Each of the last four parameters set the radius of a corner. The radii start with the top-left corner and move clockwise around the square. If any of these parameters are omitted, they are set to the value of the last radius that was set.

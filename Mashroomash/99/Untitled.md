## Project Theme

I love dinosaurs. I was a stereotypical dinosaur-obsessed child who memorized random facts about prehistoric creatures and dreamed of becoming a palaeontologist. Well, that didn’t really pan out; I became a 3D artist working on video games instead. As my interests shifted from the sciences to the arts, my appreciation for dinosaurs didn’t disappear, though. I still enjoy cool science facts, but I am now more drawn to the visual aspects—I especially love the way fossils of prehistoric creatures look, and I have been incorporating them into my art from time to time. In this project, however, I reconnected with my inner child to create a playground my younger self would love. I wanted to design a place that evokes a feeling of childhood wonder and tiny adventure.

With this project, I aimed to use everything I had learned so far to create a visually cohesive piece. I was particularly keen on incorporating bold, vibrant colors, which my previous environments mostly lacked.

I worked on this piece over my university winter break, so I only had about a month for it. There was no time to create many assets; the project would have to rely on only a couple of elements.

## Pre-production

Main reference board for my project.

My initial set of references consisted of a mix of real-life images and artwork. I gathered several pieces that featured a style, color palette, or atmosphere I wanted to replicate from a range of digital artists I admired. I specifically looked for works that showcased mastery in creating relatively empty scenes, such as fields of grass, which helped me maintain confidence in my small scope. The real-life references were mostly pictures of playgrounds and playground equipment. They provided a starting point and offered valuable insights on how to transform playground elements into dinosaurs.

Playground and dinosaur references.

I started brainstorming from creating some concepts of the dinosaurs and an initial idea of the composition. It was very messy, but it was all I needed at that stage!

Initial concept sketch.

To get some inspiration for the stylised look of the main props I used images of real-life toys and plushies. They were a great base for developing the shape language for my dinosaurs. I planned out a little family - a mum slide and baby spring rockers. I made sure that my concepts were not only cute and visually appealing, but actually usable, which was a very fun problem to solve.

Designing the dinosaur playground equipment.

I then moved on to creating a blockout to refine the composition. I prefer to do this in 3D, where it is easier to move and adjust elements. Afterward, I returned to 2D and sketched the details over a screenshot of the blockout. With the main composition established, I find this to be the best way to plan the details and smaller shapes. It is also a great opportunity to experiment with the initial color palette. During this stage, I worked closely with my references. A helpful trick I used was pasting my colored sketch among my reference artworks to see if it looked like it “belonged” there. This approach put me in a good position to start working on the project and to feel confident in the art direction.

## Production

### Unique Props

I started by modeling, sculpting, and texturing the main assets—this is the most enjoyable part, which helped me maintain my momentum! I used references showcasing sculpts, including some amazing works by [Jasmin Habezai-Fekri](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/J9Bgm0?ref=discover-the-rookies). I also utilized the Orb Stylized brush pack, which is highly regarded among many 3D artists. Throughout the process, I kept my reference board open to constantly compare my work against the visual targets I aimed for. While creating stylised 3D art, it's still important to base it on reality; in my case, this included adding wear and damage to convey the feeling that the playground has been used.

Sculpted dinosaurs.

To keep the textures consistent, I used smart materials in Substance 3D Painter, which helped maintain the style and sped up the process. A typical smart material began with a base color layer, followed by a layer of a slightly darker and, importantly, colder color using an ambient occlusion generator mask. Sometimes, I also applied a linear gradient that stretched from the top to somewhere in the middle of the model, accompanied by a layer of a brighter and warmer color. These layers significantly contributed to achieving that stylized look I love. Additionally, I added a curvature highlight layer to enhance the sculpted detail. Layers of dust, dirt, and damage—especially on the lower parts of the models—made the objects appear more believable and helped blend the transition between the props and the ground. Without these details, an asset would look out of place in the scene. I used a combination of generators and hand painting to achieve the best results.While creating stylised 3D art, it's still important to base it on reality; in my case, this included adding wear and damage to convey the feeling that the playground has been used.

Dinosaur smart material layer structure.

Although the albedo contributed significantly to the textures, I also paid close attention to the roughness and metallic maps. Having distinguishable variations in roughness and metalness can enhance even stylised models. This includes not only differences between materials, such as plastic and metal, but also variations within the same material. After all, no object's surface is truly uniform. During the texturing process, I wasn't afraid to "cheat" a bit to exaggerate the material properties. For example, in the spring rocker model, I added a slight pink gradient to the metal spring at the top where it connects with the body, simulating the reflection of the dinosaur's belly in the metal and visually "gluing" the two elements together.

The final touch on my unique textures was a _Lighting Stylised_ filter. I applied it to a grey base colour layer with soft light blending mode and tweaked the settings until I was satisfied. It is a very useful tool to play around with if you’re creating stylised textures - it makes your models look nice and punchy.

### Tileable textures

I created the trim and tileable textures for the building in the background in Substance 3D Designer. I used the wall module as a base to sketch out the plan for the brick trims and plan my texture sheets.

![](https://discover.therookies.co/content/images/2024/10/13.jpg)

Sketching on top of the wall module screenshot helped me design my brickwork and plan a trim sheet.

When working on stylised textures in this software I love creating a brushstroke-like noise using Slope Blur Grayscale node, paired most often with the Crystals noise as an input.I reused the tileable bricks texture graph in the trim to save time and ensure consistency. This material would not be visible from up close in any of the renders, so I kept the details fairly low.

### Vegetation

The element that probably took the most work in the engine was vegetation - I was going for that stylised fluffy effect on grass and trees. I set up a runtime virtual texture which blended the grass with the ground. I also used a panning noise to simulate the highlights flowing through the grass as it waves in the wind. Getting the normals right was crucial to achieving the desired look. The grass was made up from groups of planes which needed to have their normals pointed up - otherwise the harsh shadows would sabotage the fluffy effect. You can change the orientation of normals in your 3D modelling package, the method depends on the specific software.

![](https://discover.therookies.co/content/images/2024/10/15.jpg)

Grass clump mesh with normals pointing up.

In the trees and bushes, the normals would need to mimic the overall shape of the plant instead of being attached to the individual planes in the clump. I used a transfer properties modifier in Blender to make the bushes and treetops ‘inherit’ the normal orientation of a rounded shape that encompassed the whole object. That way the shading in the engine could support this appealing gradient-like effect resulting in fluffy vegetation. I used a fresnel node with a brighter colour on the outsides of the plants, which mimicked sunlight shining through the less dense leaves on the surface of the treetops and bushes.

### Scene assembly

Once all the assets were completed, I put them all together in Unreal Engine. A key element to achieving the desired look was having editable parameters on my materials to tweak things like hue, brightness and saturation of the colours.

![](https://discover.therookies.co/content/images/2024/10/16.jpg)

Initial scene assembly in Unreal Engine.

Although most of the colour palette was decided during pre-production I left some room for adjustments. I also added a green and brown controllable noise to the master materials which allowed me to add more dirt and moss to the selected assets. This further helped to ground the models in reality and glue them together visually.

The composition remained similar to the blockout with some minor tweaks. The background has undergone the most changes as I added some more wall modules at the top of the building to make the shape more interesting.

Final composition.

I hand-painted the clouds and placed them in the scene using transparent planes. This method was the easiest to control the final look and I could get away with it because the scene would only be viewed from a couple of angles.

In many of the stylised art pieces that I took inspiration from I saw flowing wind lines flying through the sky. Those were ribbon particle effects that were much simpler to create than I anticipated - a simple tutorial on YouTube was all I needed to make them. I also created some particles resembling leaves floating in the wind, which, combined with the moving foliage, sold the presence of wind in the scene.

Particle effects and cloud planes.

### Lighting and atmospherics

This part truly made the scene come together in a way that I was hoping for. I did not use any lights other than the directional light, and finding the light angle made the objects in the scene look interesting and gave the environment depth. I changed the options in the Sky Atmosphere and the Sky Sphere to make the sky colour cooler and more saturated, making it contrast with the rest of the scene. I also used trees to cast shadows in some places over the playground to introduce more variation and highlight the points of interest - the dinosaurs. If viewed outside of the camera angles the renders were taken from, some of the trees were floating, but as long as I achieved the desired effects in my shots that’s all that really mattered!

![](https://discover.therookies.co/content/images/2024/10/20.jpg)

Zoomed out scene - some objects are floating to create the best possible composition seen from the camera angles.

### Fog

The volumetric fog with a slightly blue tone added depth to the scene and helped with the stylisation. Thanks to the fog some elements that were further away appeared to have less detail, in certain places they even looked nearly like a flat colour. This is a trick that I noticed in traditional art and even stylised digital painting - the less important elements or parts of the background were simplified drastically, sometimes to the point of flatness. It helped my scene appear more like a digital painting and let the viewers focus more on the playground.

### Post-processing

The post-processing volume has a lot of powerful options that help to create a great stylised environment. I mostly used the colour grading settings to adjust the saturation and colour balance. I also adjusted the contrast - turning my screenshots into grayscale made it very easy to see if the colours were contrasting enough.

## Summary

If I was to summarise my favourite approach to stylised 3D art it would be _simplification and exaggeration._ I strive to simplify certain features and exaggerate others to create interesting shapes. This principle applies to any aspect of environment art, from modelling to texturing and post - processing. I was very happy with my ability to apply it to my Dinosaur Playground - the final confirmation that my efforts were not in vain came when I pasted one of the renders into my initial reference board of art - it felt like my piece had a similar style and atmosphere; it felt like it belonged there.

It has now been a couple of months since I completed the piece and looking back I feel like there are so many things I could still improve, but this kind of feeling is inevitable for a growing artist. This project enabled me to develop the way of thinking and key workflows that I have been using in my artistic practice to this day. Although I love working in this style, my ambition is to learn to work in a variety of artistic directions and I am excited to explore those in the future!
